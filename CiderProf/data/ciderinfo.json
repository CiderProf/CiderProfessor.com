Expounding on that tradition, we have employed a yeast blend that finishes dry, yet still preserves a prominent stone fruit nose and apple palate.",

However, this cider fits in a unique space of straddling the border between being a complex standard cider—with some sweetness and prominent apple flavor—and a farmhouse cider. They’ve done this by using a traditionally sweet apple (low acidity and low tannins)—Jonagold—but with production methods that leave the edges rough. In this case I think it worked really well. While it definitely has a strong raw flavor, compared to some farmhouses it is much more drinkable and has a complex mouthfeel that makes it really interesting.

The finish arrives <i>really</i> late, I mean you’ve had your first taste and your mind has moved on to \"what's for dinner?\" and then a mild heat begins to rise up slowly. But it is not overpowering. It was very clever to use grains of paradise which has a cardamom-like flavor (think chai tea or certain Indian curries) and natural notes of citrus with orange peel to double down on citrus and have that play with the spice. I think this is definitely best when paired with food, otherwise the grains of paradise stay on your palate just a little too long for me. There is so much happening on your tongue. This is one of the most interesting and complex ciders I've had in a while, but it is still approachable with enough sweetness to keep even casual cider drinkers engaged. I wouldn’t want to drink this every night, but I could see how some of you may fall in love with it. It is a great cider for a savoring session.

When you let this sit for a bit, and aerate, the woodsy smell really becomes more pronounced. It reminds me of the smell of my clothes after a camping trip in the woods.

It is medium bodied and probably best fits the off-dry or semi-dry category. It is what I imagine a local would get at a country pub—like the Red Lion in Grantchester—on a lovely spring Saturday to watch a little football and get away from it all for a bit. Maybe even hoping someone will grab a seat nearby and strike up a conversation. This makes me crave a Sunday roast, and it will have you licking your lips and wanting to watch some sport on the tele too. Bought by Molson Coors in January 2018, it will be interesting to watch what becomes of Aspall, one of the oldest cider houses in the United Kingdom that once produced the drink of empire before the IPA gained prominence.

The nose is really lovely—bright and fruity—with a golden amber color. It smells like getting your face shoved into a box of fresh crushed apples (a good thing), but the taste doesn’t quite live up to the bold aroma. It is a bit on the dry and watery side for a standard semi-sweet. You get both acidity and a bit of a tart note, though not much of a finish. It goes to show how the experience surrounding a first taste can shape one’s organoleptic memory. The sunshine, noshing on freshly picked Rainer cherries and the great company all influenced my positive memories of that Saturday morning. Unfortunately, this cider doesn’t live up to that memory, or maybe as the can suggests I got a \"diverse batch\" this time that didn’t meet my personal and subjective tastes on this day. I still do recommend this cider, just not enthusiastically. If it is the only cider on the menu, order it, but if you have other options for more highly-rated ciders, or something more interesting, you won’t be missing out on something exceptional.

This shows up in lots of sporting venues, usually at a ridiculous  price, and for me it’s never worth it. I’d rather find a water fountain. This is the Bud Light of hard cider. Dilly Dilly!",

Because I have never liked beer, for three years I would go and order an over-priced Coke. Then one day, at the Mill Pub in Cambridge, just off the Cam River, my supervisor ordered a Magners Cider. I asked ignorantly \"what is a cider?\" He told me and after he walked away I asked the pub keep to try one. The rest is history. \r Magners has a unique orange-Amber hue with a smell of bittersweet apples and some fermentation. It tastes dry and warm and is sharp and refreshing on the tongue. It is a unique mix of varietals and flavors that has you sucking the last bit of flavor from your tongue. There are even traces of fruity tones. It needs to be drunk straight away, don’t let it sit too long.",
        "Prodct Description": "We love making cider, but we reckon there’s only one way to do it properly. That’s why we’re still taking inspiration from the historic methods we used when we started making cider back in 1935. That’s part of the Magners taste. So in this way we use 17 varieties of apples, waiting until they drop before pressing and filtering them in the traditional way. We take time to ferment the cider and even more time to let it mature, up to 2 years in fact, tasting it along the way. Sure, there are faster ways of making cider, but then it wouldn’t be Magners.",

They've created something really special here.

Indeed, it is incredibly smooth, and probably the smoothest mid-note in a sidra I’ve had to date—but it is still pretty zesty.

At moments it is tart, at other moments it produces fresh apples with subtle sweetness, and at still other moments it is interestingly bitter (in the right way) and with reminders of the alcohol at the end, which is perfectly warming.

The nose has a rich and round aroma of bittersweet apples with slight yeasty notes. The taste too is round with a full mouthfeel. It has similarities to a raw scrumpy with a sour middle phase, but it has a tart final phase with a balanced finish. Hints of burnt caramel. It is somewhere between a semi-sweet drink and a farmhouse cider that presents as fairly tart but not too sour.",
        "Prodct Description": "The fruit for this Cider comes from our own Topaz-Apple Orchards. This variety is high in acidity which gives great balance. A hands off approach during vinification is crucial and lends to the character of this Cider.

The label and branding is intentionally unclear on this point, however, the taste’s artificial flavor seems to confirm it. Nonetheless, this is a pretty good drink experience. It does have a lovely pale gold color and big billowing bubbles and the nose is full of sharp apples. The body is fairly characterless, and this comes across as a very light cider. It is pretty sugary sweet but definitely refreshing.

It reminds me of my mom’s cherry pie at Thanksgiving. This is what one would come to expect from a Rev. Nat’s cherry cider, it is complex with multiple layers. You are first struck by the sharpness (very bright) that is enhanced by the tart granny smith apples. Once the natural burn settles you are left with a long middle phase of cherries that are elevated by the subtle spices (cinnamon is most obvious but one suspects Nat West has something else up his sleeves) and then it finishes with another tingling of the tongue. It is refreshing for sure, but as with all Rev. Nat’s ciders, you will miss things if you just gulp it down. Either way it is enjoyable, but best enjoyed slowly. I do wonder if this wouldn’t have been a candidate for an unfiltered, fuller-bodied, cider. It is sharp and smooth, but would a thick juicy cider have been more of a special fruit cocktail than this bright drink? A complex texture would have complemented the fruit and spices. Regardless, it is really well done. ",

It is fairly still but gives the tongue a slight tingle and leaves a taste of blueberry for ages. It does have some wine-like qualities, though much sweeter than most wines and its texture is pretty unique amongst ciders. I was worried about the lavender, but it is not very noticeable and doesn’t give much of a floral taste, but it does round out the acidity. This was a great cider experience from start to finish.

It has a quick bite of acidity from the apples which opens into a bold mix of tart and sweet sure to make you lick your lips. This has a full-berried flavor that some might find a bit medicinal, but this may only be because the only other time I have had elderberry has been in syrup for medicine and am just making a mental connection between the two.

You swirl it once and you get mango. Swirl it again and it’s passionfruit, again and it’s an alpine meadow—a real rich and fruity flavor. Wow! So many things happen all at once on your first sip. The mouthfeel is superb. It has a medium-to-full bodied creaminess that is delightful, reminding one of a nice honeyed mead. The tropical fruits are really felt on the backend where the fruity sweetness really comes forward, but the nuance of the other flavors keeps it from being overly sweet. For instance, when the spice of the tea mixes with the zing of the alcohol it creates something your tongue can savor. \r Though I was skeptical about the black tea (I hate tea and coffee) it really makes this interesting and completes the drink. Tea is not an obvious flavor for cider, and there are moments where when you get a brief whiff of tea in the nose that momentarily confuses your brain—am I drinking something fruity and tropical or something herbal and earthy? But the Old Mine has somehow balanced the two and pulled off something special. /r When I hadn’t even finished my first can of this I was compelled to text my best mate the below picture (on Instagram) and tell him \"I may have a new favorite!\" If it is not the best cider I’ve ever tasted, it’s certainly one of the best, and it won’t be easily forgotten.

It definitely tastes back sweetened, which isn’t my favorite, but it is easy to drink and has a fair amount of sweetness with a gentle tartness to it. What is most unusual, is its finish. It is hard to put my finger on it, but it is pretty alcoholic and lacking a distinct flavor. But I still find it pleasant. Mellow, easy drinking, but packs the punch of a proper drink.",

I had a prototype of this drink in their taproom about a year ago, but this is much better (and I have had a couple of six packs worth of this drink now to confirm that) I like everything about this drink. It is medium bodied and fairly sharp, but perfectly satiating as it slides down oh so easy. It has a big bold flavor that is equal parts sweet and tart as the juiciness of the pear perfectly matches the puckery goodness of soft blackberries. It has a long fruity finish that will leave just enough tartness to prompt you to lick your lips. It is like hiking through the thick green undergrowth of the Pacific Northwest and picking soft blackberries in the sun and having them burst in your mouth as you amble along. This is darn near a perfect drink. I’m serious, while this may not be the most complex, sophisticated or expertly crafted cider I’ve ever tasted, I’m pretty sure that if something happened and this became the only cider I would ever be able to drink again for the rest of my life, I’d be okay with it.

The first pull is marked by a pretty strong acidity, but with smoother edges than other farmhouses. Its really dry, but the second note is a complex mix of alcohol and bitter cider apples that lingers for a bit. Finally, you get some slight tartness at the end. It is pretty acidic, but one of the lightest farmhouses you’ll find. One is left with an overall impression of sourness with this cider. It is a good, complex cider that will eventually die and become characterless in body and almost bitter if you don’t drink it quick. This is a well done take on a farmhouse rosé.",

When drinking it, it is fairly sharp though goes down smooth and is still clearly an apple cider (it does not taste like a wine-based sangria) that is sweet, light and a bit whimsical. However, like the nose, I am not convinced the supporting characters worked well as an ensemble. I’m not sure they all work well together. Apple and cranberry; blackberry and pear; strawberry and banana are all classic fruit flavor pairings, but the seven fruit flavors in here do not create a unified whole but pull in multiple directions. You have acidity in orange and lime, but softer fruits with pear and passionfruit mixing with random strawberry notes, but it doesn’t completely come together.

Since Dolgo crab apples are an extremely high acid apple we allow our Dolgo Cider to go through malolactic fermentation.  This is a process where malolactic bacteria convert the malic acid in the cider into lactic acid.  Lactic acid is much softer on the pallet and gives the cider a more pleasant feel.  Since the malolactic bacteria live in the wood of the Dolgo barrels we use the same barrels year after year to mature the Dolgo Cider. \r Once out of barrel we rest the cider on plums. Our plums from this years Plum Dolgo are Italian Plums from a local Missoulians backyard.  We hand crushed 300 pounds of Italian Plums and added them to the cider.  The cider rested on the smashed plums for one week.",

It burns the lips just a tiny amount but there is an overall soft mouthfeel and a bit of sleepy tartness in the finish. It is amazing how you can fit so much of the essence of an apple into such a light drink. There is an innocence and playfulness to this drink that is charming. Incredibly approachable, it is pure and mellow. You get the experience of a tranquil Swiss orchard after bottling in the summer. One can almost picture the tall green grass swaying below the verdant hillside of La Berra Mountain with the Alps just beyond.

It is deep gold in color with a burst of citrus in the nose, to the point of sourness. This is a pretty powerful botanical cider with a satiating body and viscous mouthfeel that has very little apple flavor and is pretty dry. The most interesting phase is the second, when the hops transform into this large savory flavor of baked sourdough biscuits. I like it a lot though it is definitely more in line with a traditional beer profile than straight ciders drinkers are used to. However, it leaves just a hint of tartness on the finish reminding one that it is still an apple-based drink.

The body is fairly characterless, but it is not thin, with a fair amount of carbonation. This is a pretty flawless drink with very smooth edges, and was crafted to precision, but maybe lacks a certain amount of character or nuance. Don’t get me wrong I could drink several of these, and if you are intimidated by hops, this is probably the hopped cider with the most drinkability I’ve ever had.

This perry is nearly still and has a great medium-to-heavy body with a soft and syrupy mouthfeel. One clearly tastes the alcohol in this drink and it really warms the palate. The grape tannins in the finish add an unusual layer to a perry, but it ends with an aftertaste of heavy semi-sweet poached pears. This is a proper sessional perry, (if you like your drinking sessions strong) and contra its name, it does not remind me of sunsets on the beach, but it is a bit dark and brooding.

As with almost all farmhouse-style ciders make sure it breathes first and the taste will improve. Fruity notes try to slip through all the acid and there is a little bit of earthy stemminess from the raspberries, but sadly the acid burns off all of the delicate pear taste.

With a golden straw color and light bubbles, this cider starts off with a yeasty smell, somewhat similar to other farmhouses or scrumpies, but that pretty quickly dissipates  to a lovely and light, yet complex, aroma of bittersweet apples with just enough acid to awaken your nose. One of the easiest smelling farmhouse ciders for sure. First sip. Mmm, that’s good. As in, real good! This is very dry, and you are not going to get bowled over with flavor but the way this lightly dances on your tongue in a tannic tango is impressive. It is delicate with bitter notes and a very soft heat rises in the distance as the finish develops slowly. I think part of the beauty of the drink is blending English medium-to-full bitter apples like Dabinett, Ashton Bitter and Ellis Bitter with sugary and sweet American varietals like Golden Russet and Wickson. The blending of this is masterful and shows how a farmhouse cider doesn’t have to be bold, brash and acidic, but it can be delicate and complex with a light body and tannic mouthfeel. This is a pure drink that captures the essence of cider and displays the simple truth of how cultivating and selecting the right apples to press, ferment and blend can come together to create something special.",

Immediately in the first phase you’re getting tartness and as the second phase begins the blackberry and hops blend to make a citrusy and sour tangy flavor that reminds me of a great sour beer. But in this case it is made better by the malic acid from the apples that comes through and both balances and elevates the sourness.

Time to drink: yes, yes and yes. It does have all of the qualifications of a great blackberry cider. Despite its color it has a light-to-medium body. It has a very smooth draw and a slight amount of sharpness. The second phase starts tart which builds along with a rise in blackberry and sour cherry flavor that fills the back of the palate. Easily one of the driest blackberry ciders around, and because it is dead still it has a hard juice quality that allows you to soak in the subtly complex flavors. It is not so big of a flavor that it demands your attention, but there is enough of a tart aftertaste to steal your focus and remind you that you are drinking a sturdy and stiff marionberry cider.

I don’t know their reason behind going to the bag format, but I’d like to think it was for campers like me. It is lightweight and flexible so you can throw this in your pack or dangle it off the back and then hang it up once you make camp. \r The cider itself is a deep muted gold that has a nice full nose of bittersharp apples. It smells like a mellow sidra with virtually no bubbles. I was thirsty after hiking several miles and when I threw this back I darn near choked on this thing it was so dry. Go slowly! This feels like a strong drink, but it is so smooth, clean and light it has a calming effect and it is immensely enjoyable. It definitely has a wine-like mouthfeel. The finish is tannic and rich and lasts almost as long as the alpenglow at sunrise if you stop to savor it. Louisa Spencer and Steve Wood at Farnum Hill obviously know what they are doing as one can taste the quality in apples and blending that went into this heavy, still and viscous drink. This is not your champagne-like cider that a number of other cidermakers do, but a true apple wine that has the character, flavor and finish to match any chardonnay. \r The way the bitterness opens up the palate and enables the alcohol and finish seep in and fill the space is a delight. No sweetness, no tartness, just a deep apple character. It is similar to when the evening light dances across the face of a mountain cirque, highlighting different crags at different moments. This cider illuminates slightly different characteristics to savor with each sip. The only negative thing that I have to say about it (and this is not their fault) is that it doesn’t perfectly fit the mood I wanted as it may not be the most ideal cider for hiking in the mountains. It won’t quench your thirst and it is not refreshing in the classic sense, but it will make a delightful evening all the more charming.",

It definitely has that raw farmhouse feel with just a little bit of funky goodness often found in Spanish sidras, but doesn’t have the acid levels for a full-on scrumpy. You will get a bit of a tickle on the back of the throat though. It has a medium-to-full body with more carbonation than a traditional scrumpy. It’s right on that border of being too acidic but stops just short and remains quite drinkable. It is best after it breaths a bit and served super cold.

They have fermented almost all of the sugar out of the apples and you only get some residual sweetness from the honey in the finish. There is some acidity and bite in the first phase followed by a big dry dead zone in the middle that gives the impression of a heaviness, moving towards bitterness. It then opens up to a lighter floral finish when the honey begins to blossom on the tongue. In the end it is pretty good, but for me it has fallen between the cracks of two categories. It is not great mead—I’ve certainly had better—and there are definitely better honeyed ciders out there.

It starts to go down smooth and then in the second phase there is a big wave of smokiness, which combined with the high alcohol content makes this feel more like a strong drink than a cider. And yet, one can sense a subtle tartness in the finish. Even though the peach flavor isn’t notably strong, they’ve put enough in to balance out the whiskey taste. The contrast of the strong smokiness and the soft tones of peaches is fairly remarkable. (To my tongue there is more whiskey flavor than peach, and thus the categorization) Let this breathe a bit and the flavors gel more for a unique and pleasant aroma. It drinks more like a spirit, but this rustic and woodsy beverage has just enough softness from sweet peaches to remind one of a warm dessert of skillet peach cobbler around the campfire.",

The flavor really drops out in the middle phase which is followed by a finish that is tart, bordering on sour, with a definite bitter feel created by the hops.

I’ve had a number of hop-infused ciders from Incline over the last couple of years—most of which I’ve loved—but this one works the least well of al of theirs that I have tried.

This is really good if you like a hearty farmhouse cider.

        "Feedback": "Eric Bordelet is one of the most well-known and respected cider makers in the industry. His Sidre Brut Tendre is the sweeter of his apple cider options and it has a pale gold color with a sweet, bright, tannic and round nose that smells like a good French cider should. Empf. That’s lovely! It is drying, yet warm and inviting, with the right amount of sweet and tart notes to make it perfectly balanced. The mouthfeel is light and rich with enough tannins to give it a charming character and a small amount of minerality. This is deeply satisfying and makes you slow down, take a deep breath, and take it all in. So refreshing, so lovely, so smooth. Picking up the glass and going back to it again and again is effortless. I truly love these Normandy-style ciders that have a robustly sweet, but complex taste (though technically Bordelet’s operations are less than 10 kilometers over the border in the neighboring Province of Maine). They remind one of standard American semi-dry to semi-sweet ciders, but they are richer, more multifaceted, and more tannic, all while maintaining their drinkability, richness and beautiful balance. While it is almost double the price of buying a standard American six pack, it is worth it for this Old-World import if you want to slow down and really savor an easy-drinking cider.",

        "Feedback": "Most people think of cider as a light and refreshing summer drink, but it also has a serious side. In between an imperial cider and the stiffer fortified and distilled ciders, you have \"ice cider\" which has a much higher alcohol content because they use naturally frozen apples that retain way more sugar, thus more alcohol is produced when it ferments. It also packs a sweet punch that is intense but slightly dulled or rounded as it shouldn’t be a cloying sweetness. I admit that this is my first time reviewing an ice cider, (but I hope to do many more in the future) and I have read a lot about these and am been excited to try one because the only other alcoholic beverage I truly enjoy is port wine,† and there are reportedly similarities between these two dessert drinks with stronger flavors that have sweet instead of smokey profiles. (Pommeau, which is fortified like port, is an even better comparison) \r Eden Heirloom Blend Ice Cider has a lovely and rich cooper color with legs streaking down the side of the glass. It has a deep apple aroma as if they sucked all the essence of appleness out of an apple and put it into a viscous aromatic liquid. There is also just a note of heat from the alcohol in the nose. The taste has a very intense and sweet flavor with a heavy body. The thing that comes to mind when drinking this is that it is almost like a fancy-grade apple syrup. Like a Vermont sugarhouse switched out their maple trees for magical apple trees and tapped those to get this concentrated drink. There is a burn in the finish but also peaches, raisins and spiced notes. The overall affect of this drink then means it is best for slow sipping, luxurious chocolate, rich cheese, fine cigars, and good books. Not for quaffing. \r Like any good orchard-based blend they have mixed a number of varietals to get a good combination of cider profiles: acidic, tannic, sweet and tart. They balanced all of these things, but they are all then cranked up to 9 or 10. But even though they are intense, they don’t project the bad side of those characteristics. For instance, it is not a puckery kind of tartness, but a rich and deep tart flavor. The end result is a sophisticated North American drink that could be served as the proper ending to a fine meal at any high-end restaurant in Boston or Quebec City. Or maybe it is the perfect drink to impress at your next dinner party as you all congregate around the fire after the meal. \r †Ironic, I know, as the rise in popularity of port and the ability to procure it from their oldest ally, Portugal, in the midst of constant fighting with other wine-producing nations, was an important factor in the demise of England’s golden age of cider which peaked during the 1600s.",

It is quite astringent with a strong drying sensation and it feels completely attenuated. Sweetness is pretty impossible to detect but there is just enough malic acid to produce some tart notes and the tartness really coats the entirety of one’s palate. As there aren’t many bubbles or much acidity, it lacks bite and the initial draw is pretty smooth. It then moves quickly into a respectably-long finish of tart green apples with just enough tartness to suck your cheeks at the end. I’m not sure how it claims to recall the great traditional cider of England other than its dryness and it is ever so slightly tannic.

Yes, it is supposed to be a still cider, but this is dead and feels rather thin. This makes the delivery of the flavor underwhelming. There are some interesting bitter tannins, but I get none of the promised spiciness or oakiness. I’ve read so much about the influence Tom Oliver has had on a generation of cider makers and have been so excited to try this, but I just can’t recommend this to anybody. I wonder if I got a bad batch or a leaky crown cap in transit. A disappointment, but I’ll try again.",

The color is pretty, with a light salmon rosé hue and lazy bubbles rolling up the side of the glass. The nose smells deliciously fruity with rich cherries and a hint of floral. The taste is light, and it is a little on the sweet side with a bit of a fruity aftertaste. It is crisp on the tongue and lips with a silky-smooth mouthfeel through the middle. It then perks up a bit in the finish with some fruity tartness. Maybe just a hint of an artificial sweet taste, but overall, it is incredibly well balanced. This is much nicer going down than many of your American standard semi-sweets and I would say it is a great alternative if you like a sweeter cider that is not so intense, but is softer with subtle and unique apple flavor.",

Moreover, the cider contribution is an intense tangy tart flavor that detracts and does not seem to match well with the more subtle whiskey-like flavors. However, its strong enough that one can’t drink it, only sip it. So, you’re left sipping this weird tangy smoky-flavored drink with a mouthfeel that is too light.

To get so much from a single apple is incredible—no single grain of wheat or hops will give you so much intricacy. It is very crisp in the first phase with an almost jammy body in the middle and a finish that is sweet, tart and bitter at the same time. There are also lovely passion fruit notes in the finish with a small punch of grapefruit. Towards the end the body also lightens a little with some acidity as well. The whole drink is very well balanced. It has this initial sweet note that is tropical and a bit in your face, but then dry characteristics slow it down and allow you to enjoy what’s next. It is sweet and tropical without doubt, but has more charm and class than other tropical-tasting ciders.

Having been to Lander, just east of the Wind River Range and in the middle of pretty desolate territory, I am a bit surprised to find the apples there produce a softer more mellow cider than the greener broad valley south of the Tetons where the other two Farmstead ciders were sourced. Yes, you still get a little burn at the back of your throat. Yes, you get a bit of an acetic kick. But, overall, this has a soft mouthfeel with subtle nuances. There is a tartness to it, as well as a deep, refined and mature apple flavor that goes down clean. I guess the maturity comes from old age and surviving decade after decade in a harsh environment.

        "Feedback": "Haykin’s Scarlet Surprise is a gorgeous red-hued amber color with a nose that is not quite as fruity as the previous year’s vintage, but it has a delicate aroma of raspberries and melon and is very inviting. Quite good! It is bright on the tongue, but the mouthfeel is dryer with more of a minerality experience than previously. The most prominent note is an acidic tartness that darts across your tongue but then lingers into a really long and lovely finish that is mellow, creamy, tannic and soft. However, there is just enough tartness remaining at the end to have you gently sucking your tongue. A lovely experience.",
        "Prodct Description": "A small red-fleshed apple discovered in an abandoned Willamette Valley, Oregon. Scarlet Surprise showcase the character of raspberry tartness against a bold tannic depth. A vanilla Character follows in the evolution of flavors. 100% Scarlet Surprise apples from Masonville Orchards, Colorado.",
