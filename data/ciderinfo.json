This has a lightly foul/fermented aroma that is unpleasant on the nose and not for the faint of heart. You’ve been warned! However, this cider fits in a unique space of straddling the border between being a complex standard cider—with some sweetness and prominent apple flavor—and a farmhouse cider. They’ve done this by using a traditionally sweet apple (low acidity and low tannins)—Jonagold—but with production methods that leave the edges rough. In this case I think it worked really well. While it definitely has a strong raw flavor, compared to some farmhouses it is much more drinkable and has a complex mouthfeel that makes it really interesting. So if you like it bold, and want to get outside, pick up one of these.",

		"Feedback": "Those smart kids at Harvard Cider Company (now Prospect Ciderworks) seem to have solved a pretty complicated formula here. This thing smells citrusy and hoppy, giving off a kind of bitter pineapple vibe. The finish arrives <i>really</i> late, I mean you’ve had your first taste and your mind has moved on to \"what's for dinner?\" and then a mild heat begins to rise up slowly. But it is not overpowering. It was very clever to use grains of paradise which has a cardamom-like flavor (think chai tea or certain Indian curries) and natural notes of citrus with orange peel to double down on citrus and have that play with the spice. I think this is definitely best when paired with food, otherwise the grains of paradise stay on your palate just a little too long for me. There is so much happening on your tongue. This is one of the most interesting and complex ciders I've had in a while, but it is still approachable with enough sweetness to keep even casual cider drinkers engaged. I wouldn’t want to drink this every night, but I could see how some of you may fall in love with it. It is a great cider for a savoring session. Give it a shot if you are up for a little adventure or are crossing into cider from the beer world.  ",

On taste, the heat is subtle as the white pepper mixes well with the acidity from the grapes. It has an unusual finish that I love—a strange mix of spice and tart that play together nicely. The flavor is bold but not over the top and is still easy to drink. It almost reminds me of a savory cinnamon flavor, but obviously not. After a while you get a tiny bit of pepper that seems to peek out from the middle of the tongue. A very interesting treat.",
		"Prodct_Description": "Despite leathery wings and razor-sharp claws, the Jersey Devil's most defining feature may be his forked tongue. Perfectly attuned to local craft cider made from fresh-pressed apples. Nothing makes it tingle like the tart bite of blood-red cherries. Bright acidity of wild pinebarrens cranberries, and lingering warmth of white pepper",

Maybe even hoping someone will grab a seat nearby and strike up a conversation. This makes me crave a Sunday roast, and it will have you licking your lips and wanting to watch some sport on the tele too.

It smells like getting your face shoved into a box of fresh crushed apples (a good thing), but the taste doesn’t quite live up to the bold aroma. It is a bit on the dry and watery side for a standard semi-sweet. You get both acidity and a bit of a tart note, though not much of a finish. It goes to show how the experience surrounding a first taste can shape one’s organoleptic memory. The sunshine, noshing on freshly picked Rainer cherries and the great company all influenced my positive memories of that Saturday morning. Unfortunately, this cider doesn’t live up to that memory, or maybe as the can suggests I got a \"diverse batch\" this time that didn’t meet my personal and subjective tastes on this day. I still do recommend this cider, just not enthusiastically. If it is the only cider on the menu, order it, but if you have other options for more highly-rated ciders, or something more interesting, you won’t be missing out on something exceptional.

It’s very sharp, but also slightly jammy and full of puckery goodness. Though cold and refreshing it almost has a mulled cider essence. If you like American semi-sweets, then I think you’ll like this version coming from the Bulmers group, the largest cider producers in the UK. It’s very good.",

Because I have never liked beer, for three years I would go and order an over-priced Coke. Then one day, at the Mill Pub in Cambridge, just off the Cam River, my supervisor ordered a Magners Cider. I asked ignorantly \"what is a cider?\" He told me and after he walked away I asked the pub keep to try one. The rest is history. \r Magners has a unique orange-Amber hue with a smell of bittersweet apples and some fermentation. It tastes dry and warm and is sharp and refreshing on the tongue. It is a unique mix of varietals and flavors that has you sucking the last bit of flavor from your tongue. There are even traces of fruity tones. It needs to be drunk straight away, don’t let it sit too long.",
		"Prodct_Description": "We love making cider, but we reckon there’s only one way to do it properly. That’s why we’re still taking inspiration from the historic methods we used when we started making cider back in 1935. That’s part of the Magners taste. So in this way we use 17 varieties of apples, waiting until they drop before pressing and filtering them in the traditional way. We take time to ferment the cider and even more time to let it mature, up to 2 years in fact, tasting it along the way. Sure, there are faster ways of making cider, but then it wouldn’t be Magners.",

It is medium bodied with flavor right from the beginning. The smoothness on this is hard to beat as it has an excellent mouthfeel. The yeast and alcohol level is unique and they've created an incredibly smooth flavor that is on the sweet side, but with a lot of subtle nuances with whispers of spices, passionfruit and guava and maybe even butterscotch. And yet, apple is clearly front and center.  It is a standard cider that is complex enough to leave you intrigued, but not so overly complicated that you are confused; all the while it goes down smooth and is absolutely refreshing. They've created something really special here. It is kind of like Miles Davis' <i>Kind of Blue<i/> album, you can turn it on in the background and say ‘that’s smooth, I like that,’ or you can slow things down, really start to pay attention to the modality and enjoy it for all the subtle complexities that make it so unique.

The tannins on this are beautiful and complex and linger forever. The finish is like a good conversation—it builds slowly, is engaging on multiple levels and leaves you walking away with a warm sense of satisfaction when it is finally over. At moments it is tart, at other moments it produces fresh apples with subtle sweetness, and at still other moments it is interestingly bitter (in the right way) and with reminders of the alcohol at the end, which is perfectly warming. Andy Brennan is doing something right.

(Maybe too much—10 Barrell is the one of the latest craft breweries bought by Anheuser-Busch and Ambev) A number of beer brewers try their hand at cider, and I keep waiting for one to break through and come up with something as remarkable as their beer, but alas this falls into the category of \"fine, now you have a cider on your list as well.\" (similar to New Belgium's brief attempt at cider) Additional feedback: Soft Core is pale straw in color with a fairly strong nose of alcohol and some yeasty notes. It has a non-descript alcohol taste at first which is followed by a fair amount of bubbles, and the finish is unremarkable. There is a round mouth feel but it is also a tad watery with just a skosh of tartness at the end. It is definitely on the dry side, though it lacks the intrigue or fine finish of the high quality dry ciders. And if you leave it for a minute it really loses all character.",

The label and branding is intentionally unclear on this point, however, the taste’s artificial flavor seems to confirm it. Nonetheless, this is a pretty good drink experience. It does have a lovely pale gold color and big billowing bubbles and the nose is full of sharp apples. The body is fairly characterless, and this comes across as a very light cider. It is pretty sugary sweet but definitely refreshing.

It reminds me of my mom’s cherry pie at Thanksgiving. This is what one would come to expect from a Rev. Nat’s cherry cider, it is complex with multiple layers. You are first struck by the sharpness (very bright) that is enhanced by the tart granny smith apples. Once the natural burn settles you are left with a long middle phase of cherries that are elevated by the subtle spices (cinnamon is most obvious but one suspects Nat West has something else up his sleeves) and then it finishes with another tingling of the tongue. It is refreshing for sure, but as with all Rev. Nat’s ciders, you will miss things if you just gulp it down. Either way it is enjoyable, but best enjoyed slowly. I do wonder if this wouldn’t have been a candidate for an unfiltered, fuller-bodied, cider. It is sharp and smooth, but would a thick juicy cider have been more of a special fruit cocktail than this bright drink? A complex texture would have complemented the fruit and spices. Regardless, it is really well done. ",

The mouthfeel is not quite as full bodied as it looks, but it goes down super smooth. It has a quick bite of acidity from the apples which opens into a bold mix of tart and sweet sure to make you lick your lips. This has a full-berried flavor that some might find a bit medicinal, but this may only be because the only other time I have had elderberry has been in syrup for medicine and am just making a mental connection between the two. It has such a nice smooth berry flavor that just gets laid perfectly down in the middle of your palate. It will have you sucking your tongue to pull every last bit of the flavor out of it. Maybe not an everyday cider but it would work as a tart treat from time to time. /r And who knows, maybe it could save your life? COVID-19 seems to be hitting its stride in the United States and all pro sports have suspended their seasons and schools and universities like mine have closed or gone to contactless classes. So I thought I’d do my part by reviewing a cider that has elderberries—the best natural supplement to boost an immune system.* So it is basically a coronavirus fighter. Who says you can’t have a drink and fight a virus too? I mean it is basically medicine, right? 😉 And it tastes great, so have some delivered! \r *I am not <i>that<i/> kind of doctor, so this is not actual medical advice, take it for what it is and don’t forget to practice social distancing and wash your hands!",

This has a fair amount of lip-smacking tartness in the middle, but not over the top, and ends with a very understated aftertaste that’s a pleasure. It is a very balanced cider that both dry and sweet cider drinkers will love. It has a medium-bodied lightness common in Haykin’s ciders, and this particular cider is pretty magnificent. Thomas Jefferson, a lover of Newtown Pippin’s, would have been proud of this cider. Even though these particular apples weren’t picked at his Monticello, they were grown on land he got on the cheap from France.",

It would unquestionably leave that acidic burn in the back of your throat long enough to make the voyage from the mainland out to Nantucket. I could definitely see a salty ol’ sailor loving this!

You swirl it once and you get mango. Swirl it again and it’s passionfruit, again and it’s an alpine meadow—a real rich and fruity flavor. Wow! So many things happen all at once on your first sip. The mouthfeel is superb. It has a medium-to-full bodied creaminess that is delightful, reminding one of a nice honeyed mead. The tropical fruits are really felt on the backend where the fruity sweetness really comes forward, but the nuance of the other flavors keeps it from being overly sweet. For instance, when the spice of the tea mixes with the zing of the alcohol it creates something your tongue can savor. \r Though I was skeptical about the black tea (I hate tea and coffee) it really makes this interesting and completes the drink. Tea is not an obvious flavor for cider, and there are moments where when you get a brief whiff of tea in the nose that momentarily confuses your brain—am I drinking something fruity and tropical or something herbal and earthy? But the Old Mine has somehow balanced the two and pulled off something special. /r When I hadn’t even finished my first can of this I was compelled to text my best mate the below picture (on Instagram) and tell him \"I may have a new favorite!\" If it is not the best cider I’ve ever tasted, it’s certainly one of the best, and it won’t be easily forgotten. Let’s all hope this small batch limited release becomes a staple because cider geeks and cold drink lovers alike will cherish it.",

It is like hiking through the thick green undergrowth of the Pacific Northwest and picking soft blackberries in the sun and having them burst in your mouth as you amble along. This is darn near a perfect drink.

Wow, it’s pretty sweet, like getting close to strawberry soda levels. It does have a smooth mouthfeel with some sharpness on the tongue, but mostly sweet berries followed by a tart apple taste. I know it is weird for <i>me<i/> to say, but it’s just a bit too sweet and juicy for me. It also has that artificial sugary taste too. While I like bold flavors, this seemed to take everything just one step too far, and for you dry cider drinkers out there, probably two steps too far, so stay away.",

Fully taking in the aroma, it seems all six infused fruits are competing for attention and the result is a kinda jumbled up fruit cocktail smell with no one clear fruit dominating.

When drinking it, it is fairly sharp though goes down smooth and is still clearly an apple cider (it does not taste like a wine-based sangria) that is sweet, light and a bit whimsical. However, like the nose, I am not convinced the supporting characters worked well as an ensemble. I’m not sure they all work well together. Apple and cranberry; blackberry and pear; strawberry and banana are all classic fruit flavor pairings, but the seven fruit flavors in here do not create a unified whole but pull in multiple directions. You have acidity in orange and lime, but softer fruits with pear and passionfruit mixing with random strawberry notes, but it doesn’t completely come together.

Though it looks as though it may be super sweet and fruity, it is really dry and more botanical in taste—though you do get a nice residue of jammy berries and tartness (again, dry though). I can’t put my finger on the particular flower it reminds me of—really wish I had my wife here to help me figure it out. In fact, this really reminds me of my wife working in her garden on Mother’s Day, and if that Mother’s Day experience could be turned into a drink flavor, this would be that Mothers-Day-in-the-garden taste. You get a bit of the peatiness and can almost taste the soil in it. This puts the <i>garden<i/> in summer garden party.

Finally, there is a late finish of a bittersharp apple punch. The body is light (characterless). This cider is made from apples stemming from the Bitterroot Valley in Western Montana and if you have ever seen or hiked through this beautiful mountain range it should be no surprise that its produce would be spectacular as well. While the views are stunning, I’m even more impressed with the apples it grows because they have a unique sophisticated taste that also has earthy complexities. This is one of those times when you feel the environment, the soil and the ancient trees have created something that doesn’t feel new and fresh, but old, wise, and rugged. This is what I wanted Montana cider to taste like. Somehow, they have created a cider that could work for a sophisticated night in, or a session sitting around the campfire. I didn’t know you could have both in one drink. But now I do.",

The Idyll Acre is a high tannin cider using Muscat de Bernay, Porter's Perfection, and Yarlington Mill. It was fermented to dry, aged for 7 months, and blended with a splash of fresh McIntosh juice to finish. We experience notes of apricot, caramel, and bittersweet apple.

Our plums from this years Plum Dolgo are Italian Plums from a local Missoulians backyard.  We hand crushed 300 pounds of Italian Plums and added them to the cider.

		"Feedback": "Immediately this stands out with its deep gold color that looks incredible. There is a little bit of fermentation on the nose, but it’s warm, fruity and inviting. This is a really nice farmhouse cider that is smooth and incredibly approachable as it has a soft finish that is rare for these kinds of ciders. You get a slight farmhouse burn on the initial drag, then a brief middle note of nice tannic apple which is followed by a slow, subtle, finish that goes on forever. It has that simple apple essence (Similar to the Vulcain I reviewed recently) that is not in your face but is understated and even soothing. It almost has a calming effect. I don’t think this has the depth of character or complexity of the 2016 Taconic by Aaron Burr that I’ve had, but it is still spectacular in its simple apple essence.",

The pull on this is unique, as even though the bubbles give it a little zing, it still has a smooth viscosity to it that pulls you in. You next get some lovely tartness with a ton of tannins that coat the inside of your mouth in a dry wave. You then get this curious citrusy finish that is both tropical and bitter at the same time. And yet, it is bright and drinkable despite its very dry nature. This is a cider that really prepares the palate and begs to be paired so that it could elevate food by brightening the palate. In fact, I’d say this is the ideal drink to replace the mimosa for the cider purist and cider curious alike. I’m pretty sure the citrusy brightness and dry bubbly magic could be put up against any mimosa despite the fact that it comes from just a single apple varietal.

It is deep gold in color with a burst of citrus in the nose, to the point of sourness. This is a pretty powerful botanical cider with a satiating body and viscous mouthfeel that has very little apple flavor and is pretty dry. The most interesting phase is the second, when the hops transform into this large savory flavor of baked sourdough biscuits. I like it a lot though it is definitely more in line with a traditional beer profile than straight ciders drinkers are used to. However, it leaves just a hint of tartness on the finish reminding one that it is still an apple-based drink. The longer you let this sit the more it keeps baking, turning the nose into a baked pasta with acidic tomato sauce smell. Truly a unique cider that is still very refreshing when ice cold.",

The body is fairly characterless, but it is not thin, with a fair amount of carbonation. This is a pretty flawless drink with very smooth edges, and was crafted to precision, but maybe lacks a certain amount of character or nuance. Don’t get me wrong I could drink several of these, and if you are intimidated by hops, this is probably the hopped cider with the most drinkability I’ve ever had. Thus, it is definitely very good, but lacks the imagination to be truly outstanding. Nonetheless, it certainly gets my recommendation.",

Upon first drink, I definitely got some burn at the back of the throat, but I also got some natural pear flavor first. It is very dry but with enough sweetness to be drinkable. It also has that tang found in good high-end sidras. Let it mellow, and then pair it with fish. Maybe some tasty Hood-River-caught trout, or even Salmon would do. The middle phase of this drink is very tart and if you ignore the slight burn in the back of the throat  and focus on what is going on in the front of the palate, there is actually a long and delicate finish of pears and honey. I loved this scrumpy perry!",

		"Feedback": "This New England farmhouse cider is where you should start if you are trying dry farmhouse ciders for the first time. With a golden straw color and light bubbles, this cider starts off with a yeasty smell, somewhat similar to other farmhouses or scrumpies, but that pretty quickly dissipates  to a lovely and light, yet complex, aroma of bittersweet apples with just enough acid to awaken your nose. One of the easiest smelling farmhouse ciders for sure. First sip. Mmm, that’s good. As in, real good! This is very dry, and you are not going to get bowled over with flavor but the way this lightly dances on your tongue in a tannic tango is impressive. It is delicate with bitter notes and a very soft heat rises in the distance as the finish develops slowly. I think part of the beauty of the drink is blending English medium-to-full bitter apples like Dabinett, Ashton Bitter and Ellis Bitter with sugary and sweet American varietals like Golden Russet and Wickson. The blending of this is masterful and shows how a farmhouse cider doesn’t have to be bold, brash and acidic, but it can be delicate and complex with a light body and tannic mouthfeel. This is a pure drink that captures the essence of cider and displays the simple truth of how cultivating and selecting the right apples to press, ferment and blend can come together to create something special.",

Bold in taste and bold in experimenting with flavors. In this case it worked out great. Immediately in the first phase you’re getting tartness and as the second phase begins the blackberry and hops blend to make a citrusy and sour tangy flavor that reminds me of a great sour beer. But in this case it is made better by the malic acid from the apples that comes through and both balances and elevates the sourness. Face it, cider is better than beer and this complex hoppy and fruity drink is proof. It is medium bodied with a long tangy finish. It is not an easy drinking cider, but a complex take on a fruity classic.",

It has a very smooth draw and a slight amount of sharpness. The second phase starts tart which builds along with a rise in blackberry and sour cherry flavor that fills the back of the palate. Easily one of the driest blackberry ciders around, and because it is dead still it has a hard juice quality that allows you to soak in the subtly complex flavors. It is not so big of a flavor that it demands your attention, but there is enough of a tart aftertaste to steal your focus and remind you that you are drinking a sturdy and stiff marionberry cider.

		"Feedback": "As a special treat for my 300th review, I have decided to try Farnum Hill’s Extra-Dry Still bagnum along on a backpacking trip. I think the bagnum idea is brilliant! I don’t know their reason behind going to the bag format, but I’d like to think it was for campers like me. It is lightweight and flexible so you can throw this in your pack or dangle it off the back and then hang it up once you make camp. \r The cider itself is a deep muted gold that has a nice full nose of bittersharp apples. It smells like a mellow sidra with virtually no bubbles. I was thirsty after hiking several miles and when I threw this back I darn near choked on this thing it was so dry. Go slowly! This feels like a strong drink, but it is so smooth, clean and light it has a calming effect and it is immensely enjoyable. It definitely has a wine-like mouthfeel. The finish is tannic and rich and lasts almost as long as the alpenglow at sunrise if you stop to savor it. Louisa Spencer and Steve Wood at Farnum Hill obviously know what they are doing as one can taste the quality in apples and blending that went into this heavy, still and viscous drink. This is not your champagne-like cider that a number of other cidermakers do, but a true apple wine that has the character, flavor and finish to match any chardonnay. \r The way the bitterness opens up the palate and enables the alcohol and finish seep in and fill the space is a delight. No sweetness, no tartness, just a deep apple character. It is similar to when the evening light dances across the face of a mountain cirque, highlighting different crags at different moments. This cider illuminates slightly different characteristics to savor with each sip. The only negative thing that I have to say about it (and this is not their fault) is that it doesn’t perfectly fit the mood I wanted as it may not be the most ideal cider for hiking in the mountains. It won’t quench your thirst and it is not refreshing in the classic sense, but it will make a delightful evening all the more charming.",

This is light-to-medium bodied and fairly sharp on the tongue. The second phase is clearly sprucey with what I think is best described as the taste of essential oil of pine—or at least what I would imagine a pine flavored essential oil to taste like. No personal experience. Then there is a little tartness in the finish and aftertaste. The taste is a bit jarring and I don’t think I could easily drink many of these, but it is unique and drinkable. I see this is a bit of a novelty drink. Maybe you’re going out to the woods and want to feel more at one with nature? But it is hard to see this as anyone’s everyday drinker.

You will get a bit of a tickle on the back of the throat though. It has a medium-to-full body with more carbonation than a traditional scrumpy. It’s right on that border of being too acidic but stops just short and remains quite drinkable. It is best after it breaths a bit and served super cold.

They have fermented almost all of the sugar out of the apples and you only get some residual sweetness from the honey in the finish. There is some acidity and bite in the first phase followed by a big dry dead zone in the middle that gives the impression of a heaviness, moving towards bitterness. It then opens up to a lighter floral finish when the honey begins to blossom on the tongue. In the end it is pretty good, but for me it has fallen between the cracks of two categories. It is not great mead—I’ve certainly had better—and there are definitely better honeyed ciders out there.

It starts to go down smooth and then in the second phase there is a big wave of smokiness, which combined with the high alcohol content makes this feel more like a strong drink than a cider. And yet, one can sense a subtle tartness in the finish. Even though the peach flavor isn’t notably strong, they’ve put enough in to balance out the whiskey taste. The contrast of the strong smokiness and the soft tones of peaches is fairly remarkable. (To my tongue there is more whiskey flavor than peach, and thus the categorization) Let this breathe a bit and the flavors gel more for a unique and pleasant aroma.

This is very similar to their Mountain Dry flagship cider though more subtle, delicate and less carbonated.  Even though there is a lot of acidity in the beginning phase, it still starts out fairly still and smooth when it first hits the tongue, but once it gets to the back of the palate you really start to feel the acidic bite that’s a bit sour and funky. However, like a good sidra, it then evens out with subtle delicacies in the finish and the sourness mellows to a pleasant tartness. Still, slow sipping required. This is really good if you like a hearty farmhouse cider. It doesn’t quite earn the same marks as a Cidrerie du Vulcain or an Aaron Burr as they need to pull back on the acidity just a little bit to let the nuance of the apples take center stage. Maintaining the marvelous complexity of acidic apples while creating a drink with softness and subtlety is the mark of a truly exceptional farmhouse. This is nearly there. Cheers to the residents of the Rafter J, your neighborhood and your neighbors produce great cider.",

This tree stood long before the neighborhood was built, flying in the face of the common belief that apples can’t survive in our harsh climate.",

His Sidre Brut Tendre is the sweeter of his apple cider options and it has a pale gold color with a sweet, bright, tannic and round nose that smells like a good French cider should. Empf. That’s lovely! It is drying, yet warm and inviting, with the right amount of sweet and tart notes to make it perfectly balanced. The mouthfeel is light and rich with enough tannins to give it a charming character and a small amount of minerality. This is deeply satisfying and makes you slow down, take a deep breath, and take it all in. So refreshing, so lovely, so smooth. Picking up the glass and going back to it again and again is effortless. I truly love these Normandy-style ciders that have a robustly sweet, but complex taste (though technically Bordelet’s operations are less than 10 kilometers over the border in the neighboring Province of Maine). They remind one of standard American semi-dry to semi-sweet ciders, but they are richer, more multifaceted, and more tannic, all while maintaining their drinkability, richness and beautiful balance. While it is almost double the price of buying a standard American six pack, it is worth it for this Old-World import if you want to slow down and really savor an easy-drinking cider.",

		"Feedback": "Most people think of cider as a light and refreshing summer drink, but it also has a serious side. In between an imperial cider and the stiffer fortified and distilled ciders, you have \"ice cider\" which has a much higher alcohol content because they use naturally frozen apples that retain way more sugar, thus more alcohol is produced when it ferments. It also packs a sweet punch that is intense but slightly dulled or rounded as it shouldn’t be a cloying sweetness. I admit that this is my first time reviewing an ice cider, (but I hope to do many more in the future) and I have read a lot about these and am been excited to try one because the only other alcoholic beverage I truly enjoy is port wine,† and there are reportedly similarities between these two dessert drinks with stronger flavors that have sweet instead of smokey profiles. (Pommeau, which is fortified like port, is an even better comparison) \r Eden Heirloom Blend Ice Cider has a lovely and rich cooper color with legs streaking down the side of the glass. It has a deep apple aroma as if they sucked all the essence of appleness out of an apple and put it into a viscous aromatic liquid. There is also just a note of heat from the alcohol in the nose. The taste has a very intense and sweet flavor with a heavy body. The thing that comes to mind when drinking this is that it is almost like a fancy-grade apple syrup. Like a Vermont sugarhouse switched out their maple trees for magical apple trees and tapped those to get this concentrated drink. There is a burn in the finish but also peaches, raisins and spiced notes. The overall affect of this drink then means it is best for slow sipping, luxurious chocolate, rich cheese, fine cigars, and good books. Not for quaffing. \r Like any good orchard-based blend they have mixed a number of varietals to get a good combination of cider profiles: acidic, tannic, sweet and tart. They balanced all of these things, but they are all then cranked up to 9 or 10. But even though they are intense, they don’t project the bad side of those characteristics. For instance, it is not a puckery kind of tartness, but a rich and deep tart flavor. The end result is a sophisticated North American drink that could be served as the proper ending to a fine meal at any high-end restaurant in Boston or Quebec City. Or maybe it is the perfect drink to impress at your next dinner party as you all congregate around the fire after the meal. \r †Ironic, I know, as the rise in popularity of port and the ability to procure it from their oldest ally, Portugal, in the midst of constant fighting with other wine-producing nations, was an important factor in the demise of England’s golden age of cider which peaked during the 1600s.",

It then moves quickly into a respectably-long finish of tart green apples with just enough tartness to suck your cheeks at the end. I’m not sure how it claims to recall the great traditional cider of England other than its dryness and it is ever so slightly tannic.

		"Feedback": "Colorado Cider Company’s Heritage Blend is from the third harvest of their orchard on Colorado’s Western slope. The nose is beautiful, warm and fruity with sour cherries and grapes. Oh man! Tell me more about your orchard! With a dozen varietals of apples from across the spectrum there is a lot going on here. There is acidity and long drying notes that are the tiniest bit bitter. There is also a late burning sensation from the alcohol but throughout there is this light background sweetness that runs through all the phases of the drink—like muzak playing when everything else is going on, it is just there. Finally, at the end of the taste the slight bitterness draws you back in once more. It is medium bodied, definitely on the dry end but goes down oh so well. Sophisticated. Well done Colorado Cider Company. \r I really want to put a couple of bottles of this on the table the next time we have friends over for a meal so that they can experience the nuance of a great cider and appreciate all the layers cider can bring to the table and how it can elevate their meal. Heritage Blend just leaves me deeply satisfied. I think you will be too.",

There is a mélange of citrus flavors in the nose, and just a bit of ginger to bring it back down to earth. With that nose you prepare for a bright and tart flavor, but it is unexpectedly heavy and the pull on it is really smooth. It is a choir singing a medley of citrus notes that any saint would be proud of. But this is one of those salt-of-the-earth kinds of saints, I mean that literally too as the saltiness pulls the brightness of the citrus way back. You should not expect some bold, single-note, citrusy drink here. If you drink it slowly it is quite complex with all of those tasting notes mentioned in his discovery story: sweet, bitter, salty, sour, juicy, pithy and aromatic. Now, I am no expert on Mayan Farming techniques, but I am not picking up much apple flavor, if any at all. In fact, there is little about this that tastes like an apple cider, it comes across as a whole other genre of beverage, like a light-bodied orange liqueur.  If that sounds good to you, try this out.

It is tannic, a bit woodsy, with tart notes. It belongs in that category of American dry ciders that use sweet dessert apples, but then ferment until almost all sugars are gone and it becomes quite dry. This means that one gets some of those sweet characteristics trying to sneak through even though the mouthfeel is dry. The result is a good and drinkable cider that has a little something for both sweet and dry cider drinkers. /r Having gone through King’s Cross Station a hundred times, I am not sure what the connection is, but a block down is the British Library, stomping ground of many a professor.

It then perks up a bit in the finish with some fruity tartness. Maybe just a hint of an artificial sweet taste, but overall, it is incredibly well balanced.

This drink has a bit of an identity crisis. Even though it has a high alcohol content for a cider, the mouthfeel comes across as watery whiskey. It has a clear barrel-aged flavor, and it is strong but definitely not a spirit. Moreover, the cider contribution is an intense tangy tart flavor that detracts and does not seem to match well with the more subtle whiskey-like flavors. However, its strong enough that one can’t drink it, only sip it. So, you’re left sipping this weird tangy smoky-flavored drink with a mouthfeel that is too light. The only thing I really like about it is the reprise of vanilla at the end.",

To get so much from a single apple is incredible—no single grain of wheat or hops will give you so much intricacy. It is very crisp in the first phase with an almost jammy body in the middle and a finish that is sweet, tart and bitter at the same time. There are also lovely passion fruit notes in the finish with a small punch of grapefruit. Towards the end the body also lightens a little with some acidity as well. The whole drink is very well balanced. It has this initial sweet note that is tropical and a bit in your face, but then dry characteristics slow it down and allow you to enjoy what’s next. It is sweet and tropical without doubt, but has more charm and class than other tropical-tasting ciders.

		"Feedback": "Farmstead’s Red Canyon Nan is golden straw in color and has a beautiful nose of subtle but rich bittersharp apples that are slightly sweet. This is the third Farmstead I’ve tried, and it is the most mellow of the three. It is still in that farmhouse range as most wild apples are usually bittersharp so you can expect a potent drink. Having been to Lander, just east of the Wind River Range and in the middle of pretty desolate territory, I am a bit surprised to find the apples there produce a softer more mellow cider than the greener broad valley south of the Tetons where the other two Farmstead ciders were sourced. Yes, you still get a little burn at the back of your throat. Yes, you get a bit of an acetic kick. But, overall, this has a soft mouthfeel with subtle nuances. There is a tartness to it, as well as a deep, refined and mature apple flavor that goes down clean. I guess the maturity comes from old age and surviving decade after decade in a harsh environment. This cider stems from apple trees that have had a life fully lived. It is a food pairing dream and reminds me of a good Trabanco. ",
		"Prodct_Description": "This cider  is an ode to Nan, the legendary apple queen of Lander, Wyoming. All the apples are harvested from the Historic Ed Young Orchard planted in Red Canyon in the 1880s. The surviving trees are over 130 years old and produce some of the finest ciders we have ever tasted. The orchard is made up of many rare and unnamed apple varieties, and the mineral rich soils of Red Canyon give the apples grown there an unparalleled personality and flavor.",

However, there is just enough tartness remaining at the end to have you gently sucking your tongue. A lovely experience.",

The aroma smells of sweetened sourdough bread and stone fruits and is overall very fruity. The flavor itself is not very fruity at all. There is a good amount of acid up front followed by a heavy middle phase that is fairly one dimensional, with just peeks of tartness. There is a long and slightly bitter finish with a sour aftertaste and a tinge of singe in the back of the throat. This is a sturdy, sour, drink that is complex and a bit bitter and not for a carefree evening. A nice fatty meal would tame this a bit, but it is largely heavy and somber, somewhat like three of the characters on the bottle art. (An homage to an old Oasis album cover)",

Time to take a sip, hmm, I don’t really know what to think of this drink. It seems to be having an identity crisis. It is all kinds of bubbly—would make a Sprite jealous—so you get the carbonated rush to begin and it has the feel of a soda or soft drink. You then get some malic acid taste with some tart notes but it ends on this dull, heavy, sour wine taste that didn’t particularly thrill me. While I have had a couple of ciders made with grapes thrown in during the fermentation process, this may be the first cider blended with a completed white wine. Like many ciders trying to straddle two drink genres, it doesn’t fully hit the mark on either. It is not probably going to make a white wine drinker happy—closest thing to it I know would be a bubbly vinho verde—and it has characteristics of a raw farmhouse cider, but is simultaneously light and super bubbly? It’s not bad, it just doesn’t know what it wants to be.",

It is definitely acidic with some twang in the middle, but the finish is pretty quiet. It is actually a lot like many college careers I am familiar with. It starts with a lot of excitement, has a good amount of gusto when a major is declared, and finishes with its head down just trying to pass and get a diploma. While barrel aging often gives some ciders more of an edge or adds complexity, here it seems to soften the middle section of what otherwise wants to be a more aggressive scrumpy.

Blue Bee Cider makes ARAGON 1904 from a blend of modern and heirloom apple varieties, dominated by Albemarle Pippins, to create a light, crisp, off-dry cider. Our best seller, it pairs well with many dishes making it suitable for special occasions, barbecues, or just by itself on a hot summer day.",

It is still pretty dry, but with a lighter body that is crisp with a moderate acidic sharpness throughout the first two phases. But by no means is it overpowering. It is also definitely more tart than sweet, and the flavor drops out for a quiet and subtle finish. While it may not have the rich complexity of other farmhouse ciders, I’d probably be in the mood for one of these more often.

It almost pushes all the flavor to the top of your palette. There is then a very subtle fruit note in the finish. I am not sure what kind of apples grow in the Caucuses, but these are unique to my taste. And I guess one should keep in mind that the Caucuses are much closer to the Tien Shan Mountains, and the birthplace of the modern apple, than either Spain or England. The varietals are somewhat acidic but fairly light without a ton of complexity, depth or tannic structure. The end result is a lighter, dry, sidra that retains a tart bite but is very approachable.
