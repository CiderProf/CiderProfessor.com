        "Body": "I’ve had all these ciders before and liked them, but never tried drinking them side by side to see which one I preferred and why. Tonight, I figure it out. So, to break them down let’s start with my least favorite of the four—Strongbow’s Gold Apple which gives you a mouthful of bubbles with a bright and sweet taste. It’s really good. Strongbow’s Artisanal Blend, however, is better than its standard Gold Apple. It is cloudier, bubblier and more jammy. It has a really strong fruit finish that raised up in the back of the palate pretty late. I also got hints of grapefruit. <br><br> I like the Artisanal Blend and Smith and Forge about the same but there are differences. First off Smith and Forge has a beautiful deep amber color in the glass and is really inviting. However, it does not have as nice of a bouquet as the others. It has a really thick foam header, but it loses its bubbles pretty quick. It has a great caramel apple taste, and has the boldest flavor of the four, but it also does not have much of a finish. <br><br> My winner tonight, though, is Gumption. It has a sweetness that stays on the tongue longer. It is smoother than Gold Apple and slightly more tart in your mouth than Smith and Forge. None of these are fancy, but if you want a simple, sweet and refreshing hard cider, I think Gumption is the ringleader. /[My first comparative review, not sure I knew what I was doing at this point./]",

        "Body": "During the era of European expansion and colonialism in the early modern period, pineapples became the most impressive and fascinating food item found by Europeans in South America. This \"exotic\" fruit became all the rage in 16th and 17th century Europe and was given as a gift to numerous kings and queens. Thereafter the fruit remained a symbol of luxury, opulence and hospitality in the following centuries. Today, the pineapple seems to similarly be taking the cider world by storm. The intense flavor of pineapple with its high levels of sweetness and acidity make it an excellent complement to more mellow apple varietals, and cider makers have begun producing sweet, flavor forward, pineapple-infused ciders that are refreshing and perfect for summer. While ACE claims to have made the first pineapple cider, 2 Towns was my first pineapple love and I wanted to test it against a new pineapple cider on the market from Wild Cider in Colorado. <br><br> There is a couple of main differences with these two ciders. The first is that Pacific Pineapple is a bit cloudy and has a much thicker mouthfeel. This heavy cider tastes more like drinking fleshy, just crushed, pineapple juice. It smells heavenly like that too. You get a much more bold and intense pineapple flavor that is awesome. The Wild Cider is a bit more nuanced and is also more highly filtered and so presents more like a semi-sweet apple cider which most American drinkers are more familiar with. However, it is the mix of vanilla flavor with slight butterscotch tones that give this a creamier feel. Instead of a rush of pineapple, the Wild Cider’s pineapple character is slightly muted by the other flavors which mix really nicely. Both of these are excellent, and if I was actually out on the beach or really thirsty I would probably chose the Pacific Pineapple which is more of a thirst quencher, but tonight at home, I am going with the slightly more sophisticated and refined Wild Cider Pineapple.",

        "Body": "September is nearing an end and fall colors are starting to burst out all over my neighborhood. I find the crisp nights mix well with crisp ciders and make for great drinking sessions. So tonight I have two ciders (Honeycrisp and Late Fall) from a new cider maker in Colorado that is making really high quality ciders. Almost all of Haykin Family’s lineup is made up of ciders that resemble sparkling wines and everything I have tasted has been light and bubbly. The second drink is an Outcider from 2 Towns based out of Oregon. This is one of their flagship ciders available in the Pacific Northwest or online. Lastly, is a widely available cider from British giant Strongbow. Artisanal Blend is marketed as a slight cut above their standard Gold Apple or Original ciders. <br><br> All three of these are great ciders but there are definite differences. As mentioned above, both of the Haykin ciders are lighter than the other two and more bubbly—with Late Fall having the most obvious bubbles. As you can see from the pic the colors are all pretty different too. Both Artisanal Blend and Outcider are lightly cloudy and Artisanal Blend has an orangish hue where Outcider is a pale yellow; both of the Haykins are a golden straw color. There are differences in flavor as well with the Outcider being the most aggressive as it is a farmhouse-style cider that utilizes the raw flavor of the types of apples crushed and fermented with a good amount of acidity that packs a punch. The Artisanal Blend on the other end is the sweetest and has a nice jammy mouthfeel. Honeycrisp is probably the driest of the four, but is very drinkable. My favorite of the night has to be Late Fall and not just because this seasonal cider fits the mood perfectly. It has such a delicate profile, with a bit of sweetness and raspberry flavor, and the beautiful taste really lingers forever. The Artisanal Blend also has a great finish and lingering aftertaste and would probably be my choice if I was on a budget—you can get about 7 Artisanal Blends for the price of one of one Late Fall—but Late Fall is also a more intricate and delicate flavor and would be the choice if you wanted to pair it with a meal. While the Outcider is great, its raw and gritty profile seem more appropriate for a different mood. Thus, for a nice celebratory night in tonight, I want the elegant and soothing Late Fall from Haykin. It is excellent.",

They both smell great as the Off Dry has a nice fresh apple aroma where Alma is more tart. As the name implies, Off Dry is not fully dry but not completely sweet either (so semi-dry according to the terminology I use), whereas Alma is more of a true semi-sweet, though it’s most prominent flavor is a tart green apple taste. For me, even though Off Dry is good, it is almost too carbonated, doesn’t pack much of a punch with flavor and does not have a smooth finish. Not bad, but I think Alma is the clear winner as it has more distinct flavors and is a better-balanced drink. If you find yourself in Colorado and are craving an easy drinking standard cider, nothing fancy, I’d start with the Alma unless you’re shy with tart and sweet.",

While the Lone Star State isn’t known for this tropical fruit, it doesn’t mean it can’t make a mean pineapple cider. I am not sure how they are sourcing their pineapple juice (puree in the case of Bishop and concentrate for Austin Eastciders) but, regardless, both have crafted a super tasty end product. And to be honest, there is not much separating these two drinks, they are two of the most similar tasting ciders I have ever tasted side by side. But here is how they break down: <br><br> They are both pretty cloudy in the glass, you even get some unfiltered bits (which = yumminess), but the Bishop is a bit darker. I also like the nose of Bishop better as it smells like a thick, rich and juicy pineapple. The Austin cider has just a hint of pineapple and a slight fermentation or yeasty smell. When it comes to mouthfeel the Bishop is ever so slightly thicker whereas the Austin is a teeny bit lighter and maybe a little smoother. The Bishop has a bit more acidity and you get three phases with pineapple, followed by sharp acidity and then a lovely pineapple reprise. It also has just the right amount of sweetness—not too much or too little. Like the nose, the flavor of Austin has just a little bit of yeast in it and it also feels a bit stronger in alcohol taste. <br><br> Even though these drinks are very very similar, I do have a slight preference for the Bishop and would probably grab that one from the fridge if I had an option between the two. It is bolder, a little sharper and has a clearer pineapple flavor without being overpowering. It also lacks the light yeast notes of Austin Eastciders. Bishop’s Apple Pineapple is excellent, give it a try.",

Woodchuck has been a staple on the scene since the 1990s, and though Angry Orchard is younger, its launch by Boston Beer Company has allowed it to have a national presence and it can even be found in many national restaurant chains. Indeed, when we in the American cider industry talk about American \"standard ciders,\" these two drinks in many ways have set that standard. Though these two are found much more widely these days, by no means does that mean that they are mass-produced bums. They are still well-crafted ciders that are very good especially if you want something cold and easy to drink on a warm day. Notes: They are really very similar, both are medium bodied and fairly sweet. They are nearly identical in color, though there may be slightly less carbonation with the Amber—however, it has a bigger head and more fermentation smell in the nose. The Crisp Apple has a burst of candied apple flavor (slightly artificial tasting) and is slightly sharper on the tongue whereas the Amber is more mellow. The Crisp apple has a longer finish with a warm and sweet tone. I give the slight edge to Angry Orchard, but you cannot go wrong with either.",

If you are just looking for a raw OJ taste with a bit of a buzz then Mosa is for you, but Grand Mimosa has a better blend of flavors and retains a cider quality to it.

I found it interesting to come across this offering from Harvard Cider Company with grains of paradise—which I’ve never had before in a cider—sitting next to the local Ironbound’s Devil Harvest with white pepper, and I thought I had to try these to ciders cide by cide. When breaking these two ciders down, it should be noted from the start that neither is very hot, despite the spice. Devil’s Harvest has a fruity nose and is no doubt better smelling than the Paradise, which has a much more savory aroma that is herbal and unique. So, the Ironbound wins points for being more inviting. When it comes to flavor, again, Devil’s Harvest is more berry and fruit forward and better suited as a summer drink whereas Paradise profile is citrus paired with a more grain-like flavor. <br><br> Both are complex and what you would expect from two ciders standing in for two of the most illustrious universities in the world. Both are only for those interested in modern ciders and something unique, yet still approachable. If you are a beer drinker then go with the Paradise, but if you like sweet and tart ciders, like me, I’d go for Devil’s Harvest. Neither way will you go wrong, unless you walk into Public Wine with your Yale shirt on.",

The Anthem was kind of in that no man's land of not dry enough for a true dry, nor sweet enough for a standard semi-sweet.

As for initial appearance the Joker is definitely more pleasing with its darker color and Citizen’s off-putting smell. Joker is fuller bodied and tends to hit a single note where Citizen has more things going on all around your tongue. Citizen also has a longer, better finish, and its higher sugar content mixed with lower ABV allows some of the fruity sweetness to come out more. Joker goes flatter when swallowed then the lightest of tartness comes after, where Citizen has a more sustained finish and its taste makes a stronger, more sustained, argument throughout. So it gets the nod for flavor, but the smell is a problem (which dinged its grade) and if you don’t think you’ll want to put up with it, go with the Joker which is a safer option, especially if you are buying for a party or non-cider drinkers.

Juicy, ripe, tart and bold. The Crispin is fantastic and the pear brings a smooth and fleshy sweetness that makes it so easy to go down. Crispin is lighter in both taste and color, and is crisper with a little more tartness. This softness is contrasted with the deep richness of the Merriweather. Blackberry Boom brought the flavor its color teased (more so than 2 Towns Made Merion which also had this dark jammy color but was no where near as bold and full of flavor as the Blackberry Boom). It is fuller bodied, juicier, and bolder than Crispin. These are both highly recommended but if a blackberry fruit bomb sounds good, find a way to get to Idaho, or have Merriweather ship you a bottle.",

Octorock definitely has better glass appeal with is richer color and deeper nose as Beanblossom is almost odorless. After first taste, both go down really smooth though the Octorock is more medium bodied than the lighter Hoosier. I also think the yeasts used in Octorock provide it a bit more nuance than the very sweet Beanblossom that packs a sugary punch and is more tart.

They are powerhouses in their respective markets (though if you’ve spent time in the UK you know that the targeted clientele of Strongbow is a bit different and more bougie in the US). And while Stella is obviously known more for its beer and the other two are cider houses perched across the Irish Sea from each other, all three have good distributers and a head start on most American cider makers. All three are good, but undoubtedly there are Yankee craft options that are better. But many times these are the only options at the cider fridge or when out and about, so we need to put the big three European powerhouses to the comparative test. <br><br> When breaking them down, Cidre is tarter, sweeter and more full-bodied than the other two, where Strongbow has more glass appeal, is more apply on the nose and is the crispest. Finally, Magners has the most unique flavor with its multiple crisp varietals and being ever-so-slightly tannic. So, what’s your mood? If you want a sweeter, fuller mouthfeel with some tartness, go with the Stella. But if you want a proper European dry cider with a bit more nuance then you should go with Magners, which is clearly better than Strongbow. As I scored the Cidre and Magners the same, I am going to cheat and announce a joint-winner this time. Or maybe it is hard for me to keep my historical sentimentality and biases in check—see individual reviews.",

The Strongbow can leaves much to be desired and the Schilling artwork does not seem to capture the right mood. <br><br> When it comes to the rest of the cider experience, London dry has better glass appeal than Brown’s Lane with its shade of gold that is darker and glossier.

Most nights I would probably take the Original over the other two because it is fuller, a bit sweeter and easier going down. But if it is dryness you’re after, try the Schilling. This is pretty special because it is a draft cider that is undeniably dry without being watery or bitter. It has nice apple tones with a bit of tartness, but is still smooth.

The outsider, Miłosławski’s, is very good as a cider, but fails to really highlight the unique characteristics of the pear (which, frankly, is one of God’s best edible gifts—there is nothing like a perfectly ripe, juicy soft-fleshed pear). On first taste I was sure Crispin’s Pacific Pear was going to take the title. It had a more brilliant smell, a balanced pear taste with a smooth but complex finish. It is also probably the softest of the three. However, this perry begins to die if it is left in the glass very long and you get a more watery character and mouthfeel. Finally, you have the ACE, which if you drink it too quickly you will miss its cleverness. The pairing of pear and vanilla is brilliant. The richness, creaminess and smoothness of these two flavors just makes me want to turn on Bill Evans Live at the Village Vanguard and mellow out for bit. However, it’s too sweet (even for me, and I enjoy it sweet) and the almost candied flavor detracts from the subtle richness they otherwise achieve. If they could tone it down a notch, they’d have something truly exceptional. In the end they get the slight nod for their uniqueness, but don’t go for this if you can’t handle the sweetness, try the more mellow Pacific Pear instead and drink it quick.

        "Body": "I have made it no secret that I believe blackberries to be the king of the summer fruits and ideally suited to mix with acidic apples to make beautiful ciders. Today I am trying two more obscure blackberry ciders—one from Spain (Maeloc) and one from Missouri (Crown Valley). Maeloc is clearly darker, more carbonated, as well as more acidic on the nose. When you start to drink these ciders they both start off well, but neither has a great finish as both are somewhat artificial—one with a medicinal herbal taste (Maeloc) and the other more candied-like (Crown Valley). Crown Valley is more round and mellow on the palate and wins this head-to-head competition but there are other blackberry ciders out there that are clearly better with either a bolder blackberry taste, a smoother, richer mouthfeel or are dryer and more tannic than these two (see other reviews). Either of these drinks is fine, but neither does the blackberry full justice.",

Strong Arm is better than a lot of standard semi-sweets on the market, especially if you like it super crisp with a bright apple taste—this is great. It’s lighter in the palate than Hard Apple with an interesting rising sensation and it is also sharper and brighter. However, Hard Apple is truly unique. It can be drunk down quickly and experienced as just another semi-sweet cider, or you can slow down and savor it for the unique, intriguing cider it is. It is smoother, more mellow, complex and unique than Strong Arm, but as I write in my feedback section, it carries all those subtleties while maintaining its drinkability.

Due to its unique character and creamy vanilla and butterscotch flavor, I gave the nod to Wild Cider over the crowd favorite 2 Towns Pacific Pineapple in a previous Pick that Pineapple battle. But I remembered having the ¡Viva la Pineapple! in Portland a couple of years ago and recalled that it was probably the most cosmopolitan drink I had ever had with its pineapples from Costa Rica and its hibiscus from Burkina Faso and I knew it would be a worthy contender. And this head to head test did not disappoint! <br><br> Breaking down the aesthetics, the Wild Pineapple is shinier in the glass where Viva is a cloudy pale amber color. Wild Cider has a largely vanilla nose where Viva has juicy pineapple notes. Neither will overwhelm you with super sweet pineapple. With Wild Cider you get a full dose of creamy vanilla that is cut with the acidic pineapple. In the case of Rev. Nat’s you have a savory bouquet of spice notes that is pulled together by the pineapple to keep it just sweet enough to still be refreshing and keep it from being too complex that it becomes complicated. The Wild Cider is brighter, crisper, and more refreshing, it also presents more as an easy drinking cider whereas Viva is more like a finely crafted cocktail. So, if you’re looking to savor a drink on a sophisticated night in, Rev. Nat’s is your drink, but both are outstanding and, along with Schilling’s Passport, are at the pinnacle of the pineapple cider world. <br><br> *Caveat: This Wild Cider may have been a bad can as it was slightly soft and flatter than I remember*",

Sadly, the Everyday cider was a complete disappointment. There is no way to spin this, it was just bad. The primary flavor I got was soap. Yes, soap. I couldn't even finish it. On the other hand, Rev. Nat's created something truly excellent. Using the exotic ingredients that Nat West is known for—the question is was he so lucky he actually travelled to Mauritius to try this Muscovado out first—he created a smooth fruity cider that still has a predominately rich apple taste. This drink is subtly complex in all the right ways. I could drink this any day of the week and be happy. It is better in every way, looks better, smells better, tastes better, the can art is even more pleasant and witty. If given an option, only one of these Portland flagships is worth your time and money—and it's worth every penny.",

The most obvious difference between these two drinks is that one is filtered (Michel Jodoin) and one is not (Original Sin). Both are pretty pale in color, but Original Sin is cloudier with yummy bits at the bottom while Michel Jodoin is gassier. Original Sin has a tarter nose (and a more natural raw smell) and a tarter taste and will leave you licking your lips after every sip. The smell grows stronger as it breathes and is brilliant. It could make anyone try a cider. Michel Jodoin on the other hand is fresh, fleshy and lighter due to its champagne yeast. A touch more sophisticated and tannic. <br><br> Wow this is hard to chose as there are a lot of similarities here and maybe that’s what you should expect from a single varietal offered by two great cider makers. Michel Jodoin is slightly drier and more sophisticated, and lacks the fruity punch of Original Sin, which is a little more aggressive. The still nature of the drink also really allows the flavor of the apple to come through. Both are great, and the flavor is the same, but the presentation is different. If you like dry wines and champagne, Michel Jodoin will feel much more at home, but if you want something with an edge that really features the fruit and can transport you to a hot New York summer day enjoying a tart and fleshy white apple, this is for you.",

The differences are pretty clear right out of the can as Seattle Cider Company's is highly filtered and has a translucent golden yellow color, where Pacific Pineapple is a bit cloudy. When it comes to smell Two Towns has it hands down. The Pineapple Agave has a nice smell of earth and pineapple where the Pacific Pineapple is like you just got a cube of fresh pineapple shoved up your nose. It is gloriously fleshy and sweet. When it comes to taste Seattle's offering is a bit dry and acidic. You get a secondary agave taste with its more botanical sweetness—and if this more mellow disposition sounds more your speed, give it a try. However, Pacific Pineapple screams summer. It is fresh and bold, juicy and smooth, tropical and lush—everything you'd want on a warm sunny day—all around it’s pretty spectacular.

The Cherry Glider has an orangish amber and like the cloudy burnt orange Farmhouse, it too is fairly still. The Farmhouse is natural and a bit raw as you’d expect from an unfiltered farmhouse cider, but it delivered the least cherry flavor and I think a lot could be done with cherries that are deep, dark red and sour. The Bad Granny was the bubbliest, sweetest, brightest and most like a standard semi-sweet cider, and was definitely the sweetest of the four. <br><br> Unless you are some kind of backwoods purest, the Stone Circle is not the winner. The fight for second and third is between the Bad Granny and the German Kirsch. These two are neck n’ neck and are both very good and worth trying. Though I recommend both, they both had their faults. The Apfelwein lacks excitement and the Bad Granny tastes like lots of ciders you’ve had, where the Cherry Glider is the cherry Goldilocks—not too sweet; not too tart; not too still; juuuust right!

I don't take a flight without one, and the bold mix of tart and sweet is always refreshing and never disappoints. For that reason, I have long searched for a cider maker that could provide a fitting tribute to Ocean Spray's genius. (Sadly, I never got to try Downeast's cranberry cider before they discontinued it. This was a fan favorite from the cranberry capital of America—no offense, Michigan—but after leaving a rude note to their fans for not putting their money where their praise was, they decided to drop it from their lineup—they’ve since removed the blog post) However, I have been pretty excited to try these two contenders that are just downstream from each other—Astoria's Reveille Ciderworks' \"cranberry citrus style\" cider and Boise's Meriwether Cider. I also reviewed Meriwether's Blackberry Boom a couple of months ago—which I loved—and thus had high hopes. I have to say my expectations were pretty well met by both of these ciders which were great. You can find my extensive notes elsewhere but when it comes to direct comparisons the Tangerine dream is definitely bubblier. Both have great mouthfeels, and both have flavors that morph as they go. I think, though, Cranberry Crosscut is more cohesive throughout and the finish just lasts a lot longer than Tangerine Dream. Obviously too, Tangerine dream has a citrusy flavor, indeed Tangerine dominates and you only get a little lick of cranberry towards the end, where the Crosscut is fruit forward with both cranberry and apple. I also think that Cranberry Crosscut grabs you from first taste where Tangerine Dream takes a moment before the flavors come forward. If you are intrigued by the tangerine, give Reveille a try, I don’t think you’ll be disappointed, but if you’re looking for bold, sweet and tart flavors—the way a cran-apple drink should be—call for a Cranberry Crosscut.",

Incline’s Blood Orange is less fizzy, has a sharp citrusy taste and is cold, bold and refreshing; where New Moon is mellow, dry and sophisticated. Incline’s blend of citric hops really enhances the citrus experience. I’d say Blood Orange is more like a fleshy orange, where New Moon is more like the orange grove. Which of these two drinks you prefer is largely predicated on mood. If you’ve been out working or playing in the sun, the sharp citrusy flavor may quench your thirst, whereas the New Moon has smoother edges with its transformation from soft honey to slightly acidic apple, followed by a tangy citrus finish. Thus, it may be more appropriate for a relaxed night at home. Tonight, I chose Incline, but it is one of those head-to-heads that honestly could go either way depending on the context.",

Though Austria was the loser in this conflict, it may have just intensified the cultural, economic and political rivalry. After bringing together the smaller Germanic-speaking states into the German Federation in 1871 the new Germans continued to harbor grudges against their southern neighbor until Adolph Hitler unilaterally annexed Austria into the Third Reich. After a World War and a Global Cold War, the two nations have politically gotten along much better in the 21st century. But that does not mean the cultural rivalry is completely dead as can be seen in football stadiums and claims over who has the better humor. And now I am suggesting that maybe it should also extend into the two countries traditions of making apple wine, or cider.  Maybe this head to head competition for the bragging rights of the best Germanic cider might inspire future cultivated contests. <br><br> Both of these are orchard-based or farmhouse-style ciders. When opening the bottles, Fuchshof Most clearly smells better with its sweet, juicy and quite fruity aroma. One can also smell the pears in this drink which is something that sets it apart from the Meinklang which is from a single apple varietal, the Topaz.  When it comes to taste though I give the advantage to the Austrian cider which has a nice medium-bodied mouthfeel and is smoother and sweeter than its German rival. (Though it is not super sweet with some drying characteristics) The Fuchshof is more raw and aggressive than the Meinklang and is sour and tangy and not sweet at all. While smell is important to the cider experience, taste is king, and my vote is for the Meinklang. Let the bickering begin!",

The overall economic growth in parts of the continent combined with this growing interest in apples should create an ideal situation for growing a cider market—especially since we all know cider is more refreshing than beer! Though there are many temperate regions of this massive continent, there are also many places that get more than their share of sunshine and heat, and so an ice-cold cider is poised to take off. <br><br> Tonight, sitting on my balcony overlooking the burgeoning Mwananyamala neighborhood of Dar es Salaam where high-rises are shooting up all along Bagamoyo Road, I get to sit and enjoy two cold African ciders as I watch the sun go down over the Indian Ocean. The Redd’s definitely has more glass appeal with its brilliant pale gold color and bright nose of sharp apples, where Savanna has a slightly more fermented nose that excites less. But, the taste of Savanna is clearly superior in part because it is a proper cider as opposed to an apple-flavored alcoholic beverage (see: [link to Redd’s review]) and this clearly comes out in the taste test as Savanna Dry is fuller bodied and has more complex notes stemming from bittersharp apples and a tannic structure, which are totally lacking in Redd’s. In general Redd’s has a light body and a characterless mouthfeel and is much sweeter and more sugary than the dry and interesting South African cider. While Redd’s is really refreshing and is not a bad option if it’s all that’s available, but cider drinkers I think will prefer Savanna, which is a very good cider. Redd’s is found in the high-end malls and shops of Dar es Salaam and I have seen it in one restaurant, but Savanna Dry is much more widely available. While some of this obviously comes down to distribution, it may also be consumer demand as in this case the local host drink falls to the imported option. However, I hope the industry takes off in Eastern and Southern Africa and that I get to do many more African cider comparative reviews in the future.",

        "Body": "So in case you don’t know, unfiltered ciders are were it’s at. Most cider houses filter their drinks to make them sharper looking in a glass and because they think consumers will be nervous about having little bits of stuff floating in a refreshing beverage. But be not alarmed, it is natural to have some sediment or lees, and it almost always enhances the flavor. While you should gently shake these drinks and pour them into a glass to evenly disperse the goodies, if you forget, that last sip may be the most potent and best of the can. Tonight, I am trying to of my favorite unfiltered ciders that are pretty widely available. <br><br> Before getting to the taste, it has to be said that Fuji earns higher marks for its sharp can artwork which is on point. When in a glass, though, Downeast looks like a cloudy orange sunset and has a much more appealing nose. When it comes to taste Fuji is a bit more subtle and has some earthier undertones. Original Blend is sweeter and has a bolder flavor. So both give an authentic apple cider experience, and Fuji is a bit more mellow and really settles into the palate nicely, but if you want to have a bold and tangy experience, (or the experience of being in a New England apple orchard stuffing your face with apples, and maybe one or two in your pockets before you bag is weighed) then this Downeast will not disappoint.",

The smell was unpleasant—yeasty bread—and the taste was sour and acetic with no noticeable fruit flavor except for a brief, but fleeting, hint of watermelon in the aftertaste. It had me sucking my tongue for all the wrong reasons. Unless you are really into sour beers or just need to wake up, avoid this.

I think it is high time that the cider industry break into this market, so I decided this was the perfect time to try out two light ciders. <br><br> Just breaking them down: Bishop is more subtle with a pleasant nose where Ulee’s is richer in color, stiller, tarter and mildly tannic.

The bolder flavor of the Summit also extends to the taste and it is smoother as well. On the other hand, where Summit is still, Alter Ego is lightly carbonated and has a brighter taste. It is lighter bodied, more delicate and tarter as well. The secondary flavors—lavender for Summit and pomegranate for Alter Ego—both do a nice job complementing the blueberry in subtle ways. The lavender softens some of the acidity where the pomegranate adds a light delicate touch to the finish of an otherwise potent drink. Neither of these are for dry drinkers, both have sweet big flavors. You really can’t go wrong with either as they are both great, but I give a slight nod to Summit because I can not find a single legitimate complaint—it is bold, rich and beautiful.",

It is full of fruity micro pulp and the round notes of the passion fruit really smooth out the sweetness of the pineapple. Passport is less astringent than the Haze which is more finely filtered—though with some goodies left in the glass—and it also has a much bolder flavor than Original Sin. One drink screams for a party on the beach and begs for a drink umbrella, where the other on is a bit classier and better if you want to have a drink inside. But Pineapple Haze is not just a plain old semi-sweet. It is something sophisticated but with a fun side.

Peckham’s definitely has the yeastiest smell and taste that got funkier the more it sat. Though there were redeeming qualities like its brightness and the sustained boysenberry taste that was just the right amount tart. The Loganberry had the flattest smell and was the driest of the three. Finally, Blackbird had the most appealing smell and color—really dark. It had more body than either of the other two and had the richest and fullest flavor of the lot. It also had just the right balance of tartness and sweetness. <br><br> Each drink had its flaws, but there is also something to put each of them forward with varying degrees of enthusiasm. If you don’t want a mouthful of flavor, or you have an oversensitivity to medicinal qualities, go with the Loganberry which is dry and delicate but with a characterless body and mouthfeel. It is the most mellow of the three. Otherwise, Blackbird was the least odd, and super smooth and is the clear winner. You should go with this especially if you have a scratchy throat.

At the very least this cider is excellent, and I’d be glad to have it any day, not just when I am in a sour mood. This could easily be an everyday drinker. Grapefruit and Chill is still great. It is much more pungent smelling and you can really smell the sour grapefruit in it. It is both sweeter and tarter, shading into sour. This drink has you licking your lips and sucking your tongue without being uncomfortable. You can still chill with it, but you gotta like a bit of that sour, almost bitter flavor of grapefruit. Downeast on the other hand looks more inviting and it has a juicier, rounder, nose. The flavor feels more natural and is just a little sweet and tart. It is fuller bodied and hits on the lips and tongue just right. <br><br> I heartily recommend both, but unless you’re just out  with a sour vendetta and really want your grapefruit front and center and have it steal the show from the apple, Downeast is just more balanced and has a rich, fresh, apple flavor taste that is supported by the tartness of the grapefruit. It is great and the purity of the unfiltered genuine flavor wins again.",

Neither had any major faults, but neither had a ton of imagination either. Both had an artificial concentrated apple juice smell, but Newton’s Folly was more medium bodied and had a tart flavor that dropped out pretty quick after drinking it. The Scandinavian was lighter, fizzer and sweeter. A lot sweeter. The Scandinavian will do the trick and have you feeling good after a couple, but unless you have a serious sweet tooth, I’d give the edge to Newton’s Folly unless it was a super-hot day and you were just looking to slake your thirst.",

There are certainly a number of excellent ciders made at wineries and so I thought I would do a comparative lit review with a raspberry cider made from a proper cider-only cidery and chose Stem from Denver. At first this experiment seemed worthwhile. They actually looked pretty similar with their inviting orangish-red tones. Stem was clearly bubblier and the nose is bright crisp and refreshing, whereas as the apple wine was dead still and had a sulfidic smell that was a hint soapy. Not a good sign. Then as soon as I took a sip of the Strawbale it was over. It is heavy, dead, medicinal and just bad—and the badness just kept on going as I couldn’t get the taste out of my mouth. So, to keep this simple, go with the Stem; unless you like a smelly slow burn, then do that!",

Haykin is light and effervescent with a gentle blanket of sweetness and delicate tart notes, whereas Cousteau is pungent sour and raw.

Haykin is obviously light and it has a unique but pleasant smell, where Cousteau has more fermentation in the nose. When it comes to mouthfeel, Haykin is satiating, where Cousteau is fairly thick and unfiltered. In some ways the artwork is representative of the drink themselves. Cousteau has a fun, whimsical and bold nautical theme, compared to the buttoned-up wrapper of Haykin. <br><br> For me, I like the well-balanced sophistication of Haykin and could drink this whenever.

So maybe I should have brought a beer drinking buddy along to explain the difference between these two ciders, as one claims to be \"lagered\" and the other promotes that it is \"fermented with Belgian Ale yeast\" (this one is made by a brewery which is primarily not a cidery unlike Argus) Most of you may know but the difference between these two beer varieties comes down to the fermentation process of top fermenting (ale) and bottom fermenting (lager) and yeast. The yeasts are similar but behave differently. One brews at warmer temperatures (ale) and one colder temperatures blah, blah, blah, beer stuff, beer stuff. But, professor, how do they taste? <br><br> Neither of these is overly beer-like as other ciders I have tried, though Ommegang smells almost citrusy and hoppy. But both clearly present as dry cider. Here’s how they breakdown: Ommegang has a stronger nose of fermentation, is bubblier and the finish sticks around longer. It is sharper but also has sour notes. It feels like there is too much going on and Ommegang is trying too hard. On the other hand, I prefer the smell of Argus’ nose of juicy apples. This cider is also more mellow, smooth and self-assured. The analogy that comes to mind is that the Argus is that guy in a leather jacket that is clam, collected and quietly confident. Cool even. Whereas Ommegang is trying out all his jokes to get people to notice him and is trying a little too hard. Both are good guys, but one just seems a better catch. If you like things sour, raw or slightly funky, go with Ommegang. But if you want a good, calm and collected dry cider, go for Argus, it is very good.",

        "Body": "Okay, so today I’ve got a couple of proper English ciders and one from Oregon claiming to be an English-style scrumpy that is more approachable. From the outset, they are all pretty good, but none are going to be that drink where you say, “aw mate, I’m absolutely keen for a _______ right now.” I recognize I’m also comparing a proper scrumpy (and a wanna be scrumpy) with a straight-forward English dry cider from the southeast of England—which is pretty good but not the best Aspall makes and I think, thus, out of the running. Comparing the three none had a smell worth returning to, and the Dunkertons odor is a bit dismal. After aerating, Aspall also has a bit of a burnt smell that was off putting. Aspall is the smoothest of the three where Dunkertons has the thickest body and best glass appeal. Dunkerton’s is not an overwhelming scrumpy, whereas I’m wondering if the Scrumptown is a scrumpy at all. <br><br> But when it comes down to the proper scrumpy and the wanna be American scrumpy, I gotta go with Dunkerton’s. (though they score about the same) If you want to try a scrumpy but have been burned (literally) by other farmhouse ciders, this is a relatively mellow scrumpy that is still drinkable. The Slake is smoother, and it is more bang for your buck alcohol wise, but it lacks the richness in texture and flavor and has an artificialness that will be off-putting to some drinkers. I actually think it is the Dunkerton’s that delivers on Scrumptown’s promise of an authentic scrumpy that is approachable. Only if you know a scrumpy is not for you and you really prefer an American semi-sweet draft cider would I recommend the Scrumptown over the Dunkerton’s. Even though Dunkerton’s is not for everyone and not something that will slake your thirst, it is a lovely pint nonetheless.",

Let’s put it this way, if you find either of these in a cooler consider yourself lucky. If it is warm out and you are a fan of cider or blackberries, or both, you won’t be disappointed. Let me breakdown the differences though: <br><br> Emerald City is darker in the glass and with a sweeter nose that is almost sugary (but the good kind of sugary, not that artificial smell). Black Widow has a tarter nose and smells of nothing but blackberries that are a bit earthy. The taste of Emerald City is bolder, but Black Widow is tarter and a bit drier. Black Widow starts a bit acidic and then forms into a rounder sweeter taste where Emerald City is a big bold flavor from beginning to end. Black Widow is lighter bodied and more carbonated, and you feel the acidity at the top of your mouth, where Emerald City really burrows its way into your tongue and palate and is more still and mellow. Emerald City is also juicier and fruitier. One analogy for comparing these two ciders comes from tasting blackberries themselves. One is like when blackberries are at their slightly squishy, jammy stage right before it turns bad (Emerald City), where the other is fully ripened, but is slightly stiff in the mouth and has a bit more of that fruit skin and stem flavor that is ever so slightly bitter. So, Schilling seems to have bottled the fruit at the absolutely perfect time when it is squishy and full of fruitiness. <br><br> To sum up the Black Widow is a slightly more mature and complex taste—which may be for you—but let’s be honest, if you like blackberries you probably like it sweet, tart, bold and fruity. The Schilling is perfectly balanced with fleshy juicy pears and soft blackberries—a flavor combo that really brings out the best of both fruits. It quenches one’s thirst and has flavor for days. It is nearly a perfect drink that is deeply satisfying. Try one out!",

We have three different takes on \"dry cider,\" one is your American version of a \"Kinda Dry\" that is a bit sweet but not very nuanced or imaginative, but very drinkable. The second comes from a brewery and, as expected, it feels like a brewery making a cider with a beer yeast (and flavor), but it is the most complex of the three and pretty dry. The last cider is really a farmhouse that is fairly acidic and aggressive, and not what most Americans think of when they think of a dry cider. However, it is good and drinkable, the best from ANXO I’ve tried so far. If you’re interested in a soft entry into a scrumpy, try the ANXO, if you just want to throw back a few with some friends and have a cider that is kinda sweet and barely on the dry side, go with Portland Cider Company. But for me, on this day, I’m gonna go with City Market. Even though I don’t like beer and don’t drink it, this is interesting and nuanced enough to ponder over, but still enjoyable. It is similar to how the great pianist Bill Evans described the difference between jazz and cocktail music: one puts a thinking mind to work and is meant to be listened to, the other is just background noise.* Here the City Market is jazz and Kinda Dry just adds a nice ambiance. <br> *Pettinger, <span class=\"feebackItalic\">Bill Evans: How My Heart Sings</span> (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1998), 128.",

Wildcraft is a farmhouse-style cider enriched with earthy botanicals, citrusy with subtle spices and a bit pungent. The Bad Apple is less deviant than it projects. It is a bold imperial cider that is clean and smooth with a high amount of complex sophistication. It has a mid-note of vanilla and oak from its previous life in a barrel. It finishes with a warming honey sensation that is thick, soft and confident without being assertive or sweet.

The other stems from a rare varietal produced by Dr. Ashmead in the cathedral town of Gloucester, also in the West Country of England, in around 1700. Despite having origins that more or less stem from Georgian England, they are night and day different. 1763 is dark, still, heavy and incredibly acidic. Ashmead’s Kernel is light, airy, delightful and surprisingly lemony. Does this reflect the events themselves? The English Cider Bill of 1763 produced dark times in England that ultimately brought down a prime minister and foreshadowed the riots in the North American colonies two years later with the Stamp Act. Dr. Ashmead, on the other hand, presumably lived a more care-free life wandering through his orchards. Regardless, 1763 can’t be recommended unless you like an acidic scrumpy whose most defining note is soapiness. Contrasted with that, Ashmead’s Kernel is immensely drinkable with tart but sweet notes that’ll have you sucking your tongue and wanting more. This duel goes to Ashmead’s Kernel as 1763 was clearly off the mark.",

        "Body": "Okay, so I know it might be perceived as a little sexist for me to portray rosé as a woman’s (or even a mother’s!) cider, but let’s face it, cider companies target the female demographic with these beverages. Regardless, I thought it would be fun to try these three fairly available rosés in honor of Mother’s Day later this week. Even though it is a weird Mother’s Day due to COVID-19, the flowers are still blooming outside, and the value of mom’s day may be more clearly important now more than ever.  So let’s see if there isn’t a rosé you can share with your mom this weekend. <br><br> First off, it goes to show one can become a rosé in many ways as the ACE is a rosé due it its use of red and blackberries, the Virtue Cider is basically a farmhouse cider with color added, and the Austin Dry cider is a rosé through infusing its drink with rose petals and hibiscus. The Virtue is the reddest and fizziest of the three and also has the best nose, which subsequently is the most complex, whereas ACE was really bright and the Dry was the heaviest, smelling of fermentation. All three were medium-bodied with Austin as the driest, ACE as the sweetest, and Virtue being more acidic and sour. <br><br> When it comes to choosing a winner, the ACE is just too sweet, the Virtue is really nice and complex, but a bit sour and acidic whereas the Austin Eastciders seems just about right—deep, dry and floral. I even asked the opinion of the most beautiful mom I know—my wife—and without my saying a word she complexly agreed with me. She thought ACE was too much like juice; Virtue smelled the best but was a little too sour; and even though she didn’t like the smell of Dry Rosé Cider, she clearly picked up on the taste of roses and thought it tasted the best. So mom has it! Our unanimous pick was Austin Eastciders Dry Rosé Cider.",

So, I tried these two hoping one could serve as my new summer go to; my unofficial summer-time drink of choice. <br><br>  While Easy Squeezy is more inviting at first glance with the most glass appeal, neither had an aroma that really enticed me as the Easy Squeezy was really tart and when you smell the Sangria you are not sure what you are in for as there are a lot of fruits competing with each other. When it comes to taste and mouthfeel the Easy Squeezy was really acidic and dry and the lemon definitely drowned out both the berry and cider flavors. The Sangria was obviously more filtered, but it did have a better mouthfeel and was more refreshing. But again, the flavor profile was confused as all the fruits never really came together to make a unified whole. <br><br> The Sangria is fairly good, and the 2 Towns is okay, but neither left me completely satisfied. In fact, what I have learned is that imitations can be bad and maybe sometimes you shouldn’t mess with the real thing. As much as I love cider, I think I would rather have an actual lemonade (and to a lesser degree a sangria) on a hot summer day. But the slight nod in this case goes to Portland Cider Company.",

        "Body": "It’s May in Texas and that means bluebonnets and bees, so it is time for a roundup of the best honey ciders the Lonestar State has to offer. (Caveat: Locust says it's made in Washington and Texas, but its got that Texas symbol on the can and is readily available on shelves in Texas so I’m counting it) Right from the start, all three of these are ree-al guud! Each are drinkable and fairly well balanced so let’s break it down: <br><br> All three have a pale gold color, but Honey Pear is the cloudiest whereas the Texas Honey Cider is the clearest and most effervescent. When it comes to smell the Honey Agave and Texas Honey are almost identical with a nose of bittersweet apples and I generally prefer them to the Honey Pear which smells more of fermentation. As far as taste is concerned, the Honey Agave has the tartest flavor where Honey Pear has the boldest flavor that has both the most acidity and most honey flavor of the three. It also has pear notes, unique to the three, that really make it stand out. When it comes to mouthfeel and body, Texas Honey is the lightest and most elegant of the three where Honey Pear is heavy bodied with an almost gummy mouthfeel. <br><br> When it comes to choosing a winner, I don’t think you can go wrong. If you’re not down with any of the natural fermentation taste then avoid the St. Arnold’s and the Locust. (But again, most are pretty mild in this category) If you like it tart, go with Saint Arnold—which is only saintly if you count those prophetic figures who preach it like it is and make you pucker and say, \"oooh, that zings!\" And then there is Locust which is oozing with honey flavor. If you were one of those kids who got sticks of honey at general stores when growing up and thought “they should turn this into a drink” then this is the cider for you. At the end of the day, though, I didn’t chose the boldest flavor—which often tempts me—but I am going with the subtle and refined Texas Honey that reminds me of a clapboard-board country farmhouse surrounded by the high, swaying, grasses of the Texas plains, which inside is decorated by shiplap and flowers that have been tastefully appointed by Joanna Gaines. With subtle honey taste and full of charm, this drink would fit right in on her grey farmhouse table.",

        "Body": "CopSuperstition’s Blueberry Spaceship Box has spent months as the top-ranked cider according to Untapped. Thousands of drinkers who use the app agree that this is the best cider in the world. To test this, I got a hold of a bottle of master cider maker Jacques Perritaz, the mastermind behind Cidrerie du Vulcain. Critics have dubbed Perritaz \"the Prophet\" of Cider and the most inspired cider maker in the industry. Based in a small Swiss village just south of Fribourg, Perritaz claims to work with 200-year old apple trees and uses a method of only harvesting apples from high-branched untreated trees. The ancient apple varietals mixed with the unique terroir at the base of the Swiss foothills has won him the attention of cider and wine critics alike. So, which is better? <br><br> I recognize immediately that I am judging two different styles of ciders here and that just as in the real world no one would expect people to agree on the best film of the year and pit the academy award winner versus the top poll getter; and yet, this is my website so if I want to put the people’s choice against the critic’s choice, then I’m gonna to do it. The elements that obviously make these drinks different is that the Spaceship Box has a splash of fruit in it, it is tarter and it has a bit more alcohol flavor despite the fact that is has the lower ABV. However, the characteristic that really bound these two drinks together was their smoothness. Both have incredibly soft mouthfeels while still portraying so much pure fruit flavor. The Vulcain in particular has such a rich but approachable tannin structure that it is how I wish everyone was introduced to cider. Therefore, my pick is the Turgowy from Vulcain because the way he was able to capture the apple’s innocent purity in a bottle amazed me. Certainly, thousands of people aren’t wrong, I agree with them that the Blueberry Spaceship Box is fantastic and if you want something fruity, then you should go with the blueberry. But the Spaceship box was a bit of a single note for me and had less depth than Vulcain and its unique tannins. Thus, for a more memorable and pure cider experience go with the Vulcain.",

So to put it to the test, I am pairing it with a blueberry cider from a reputable cidery to see what happens. Here’s how they shake out: <br><br> The Spaceship Box is clearly darker—it’s really dark—and probably has the better nose with deep blueberry pie notes compared to 2 Towns lighter, more acidic nose, that to me actually smells more like blackberries. When it comes to taste and mouthfeel, the Blueberry Daze’s flavor has spice notes and more character. It is also more effervescent with active carbonation whereas the Spaceship Box is smoother, more satiating, and has a stronger and purer blueberry taste. <br><br> I think the champ has not lost his crown here, but I do think the Blueberry Daze would probably work better for pairing and so if you were looking for a blueberry cider to drink with food you might want to try this one.

        "Body": "So today is the summer solstice, the longest day of the year and the official beginning of summer. Over the last couple of years pineapple seems to have become the flavor of choice for cidermakers when doing summer seasonals (move over honey!). To honor that sweet trend and this long hot day I am comparing four of my favorite ciders, two from the West Coast, two from the East. The one thing they have in common is cloudiness due to a lack of filtration which provides for some yummy juicy bits (some more than others). I have now compared and drunk enough pineapple cider to have guessed in advance how this would have gone down, but let me break it down for you: <br><br> When it comes to the first to part of the cider experience—sight and smell—I think the Passport is more appealing in both categories. Aloha Friday and Pineapple Haze both have fairly straightforward pineapple noses and a light straw color, Viva la Pineapple’s is the most interesting with Rev. Nat’s characteristic spice notes and a darker color. However, Passport has a beautiful aroma of passionfruit and this lovely amber color with dark blood orange bits billowing up in the middle of the glass and looks spectacular. When it comes to flavor Viva certainly demonstrates the more sophisticated side of what a pineapple cider could be. Of the two more straight forward pineapple ciders, I preferred the Aloha Friday to the Pineapple Haze because it was smoother, bolder, and thicker and had more character than Haze—which consequently also dies the most and the smell becomes a bit stale after a while. When it comes to mouthfeel, none beat the Passport which just tastes like drinking fresh pressed juice on the beach. It has the juiciest, thickest, creamiest mouthfeel followed by Aloha, Viva and Haze. Though Viva is the driest if that is what you are after. <br><br> Even though my ranking of the four would follow my grading in this comparative lit session—Passport, Viva, Aloha, Haze—let me help you figure out which one you should drink. If you want a straight ahead pineapple flavor then Aloha Friday and Pineapple Haze are your best bets, but I give the edge to Aloha Friday for the reasons stated above and though it is somewhat mononote, this gives you the most pineapple flavor of the four. For the two upper echelon drinks (two A students) you should decide based on mood. Viva la Pineapple is like an overly sweet pineapple went off to grad school, bought horn-rimmed glasses and started reading Derrida and Foucault and then came home much more serious, interesting, and better able to engage in deeper conversations. Passport on the other hand is the most likely to transport you to some place else. Assuming you are grabbing a pineapple cider for some tropical, juicy and fruity fun and its whimsical nature, you have to go with the Passport. When it comes to pineapple it is still the head of the class in my gradebook.",

        "ID": 75,
        "Body": "Today is Father’s Day and I was awarded with being able to spend part of the day sitting on the front porch finishing Andy Brennan’s book, <span class=\"feebackItalic\">Uncultivated</span>. I was lucky enough to get my hands on a couple bottles of Aaron Burr Cider recently and I decided to celebrate by reviewing one and pairing it with a cider worthy of Brennan’s high standards. As any good philosopher is prone to do—and Brennan may be the cider philosopher <span class=\"feebackItalic\">par excellence</span>—he gives no simple answers about which cider or apple varietals are the \"best\" for cider making. (Indeed he somewhat eschews single varietals as they come from clones and prefers wild apple trees from \"locations\") However, he does mention both what he thinks would make for a good cider apple with the properties he likes in a cider, the Porter’s Perfection, and his favorite apple tree, Denniston Red, which has grown nearby in the Neversink River area. So, I have chosen to pair his Neversink Highlands locational cider, with Haykin’s Porter’s Perfection. Now I can’t prove that apples from Denniston Red went into this bottle, and I know he has some qualms with how Haykin has procured his apples—usually from commercial orchards that grow unique varieties, though Dan Haykin has done some foraging himself of wild apple trees—but Haykin is the only other cider maker I know that shares the deep love and respect for cider apples as Andy Brennan, so I thought this would be a great pairing. Therefore, my father’s day gift is to try these two high-end ciders from two of the best cider makers in the country. <br><br> If you’ve seen the individual reviews, you’ll see they’ve both earned the same score. That means neither is really better than the other, it just comes down to your mood—which is obviously subjective (but I always announce a winner which comes down to my subjective experience on that day). In some ways they’re similar when it comes to the quality and the care taken, but in other ways they’re not alike, but let me break down the differences: The most obvious difference just after pouring is the bubbles as almost all Haykin’s ciders are sparkling and the Neversink only has a tiny bit of bubbles from the natural fermentation process. When it comes to the nose, Neversink has a small amount of that raw farmhouse nose, but it is still so subtle and soothing. The Porter’s Perfection though is bright and tropical, and I would say that this is a wash, as they are very different but both inviting in their own ways. When it comes to curb appeal the Neversink has the edge because its golden color  just makes it look like somehow a crushed apple has been turned into thick liquid goodness; whereas the Haykin is a bubbly straw color which has never been as inviting to me. When it comes to flavor the Neversink is deep, still and rooted, where Porter’s Perfection has more pop, more zing, and is light and airy, but both are properly dry. <br><br> So this comes down to what you are eating and feeling. Do you like the natural taste of a farmhouse? Or maybe you have just been wanting to try one but have been put off by what you have read about the raw or aggressive features of farmhouse/scrumpy ciders. If so, try the Neversink Highlands as it is a great intro to a quality farmhouse cider that is still, calm, subtle, and easy to drink. Granted you must be lucky enough to find one as they are not on every corner like an Angry Orchard, but Brennan likes it that way. <br><br> Whether he's just a cider snob, or just \"focused on ideals\" if you asked him (probably a bit of both), Andy Brennan would probably say that Dan Haykin’s Porter’s Perfection isn’t <span class=\"feebackItalic\">real</span> cider because he has added carbonation, but it is a cider made with respect and reverence for apples and the incredible diversity they can display in a drink. For reasons above, this is an incredibly complex cider that is citrusy and sweet but incredibly dry and a bit bitter at the same time. I would not grab it just for having a drink—I really believe this is meant to be paired—but it’s a pretty exceptional cider, and my choice on this Father’s Day. But maybe I’ll be lucky enough to repeat this special gift of a comparison next year and change my mind.",

Both of these cideries from the last great frontier do a hopped cider (and it very cute that they color-coordinated their can color making my photo shoot easier ;o) Ribbing aside, these are both great ciders that do Alaska proud. Each of these had me thinking I should drink hopped cider on a more regular basis. Even though they are both hopped ciders hailing from Alaska, they are pretty different in a number of ways so let me break it down: <br><br> The Backcountry has a lot of hops in the nose whereas the Forget-Me-Hopped has a lighter aroma filled with more apples. This is repeated in the flavor as Forget-Me-Hopped is lighter, fruitier and more refreshing. If hops is intimidating or disagreeable to you, then the Backcountry is not your drink. It is way more beer-like with a big savory flavor. Forget-Me-Hopped, on the other hand, clearly presents as a dry cider that has a more appley and citrus flavor. The hops are present, but this is a more subtle, sweet, and fruit-forward drink with a killer finish. The backcountry is pretty still and heavy where the Forget-Me-Hopped is lighter, bubblier and is targeted more towards a wider audience. Finally, I see Backcountry a serious, session drink where the Double Shovel is easier to throw a few back and I think would probably pair better with food. <br><br> Declaring a winner is difficult because I like them (and scored them) about the same for different reasons. Again, it comes down to mood. If I am having a more contemplative drinking session it has to go to the more intriguing backcountry, but as I mentioned above, I believe the cleaner, lighter, smoother Forget-Me-Hopped pairs better with food. To test this theory, I brought two fresh cans to a fish fry at my neighbor Pat’s house who had just returned with freshly caught Halibut from Resurrection Bay, Alaska, just off the coast of Kenai Fjords National Park. First off, both drinks were heightened by the rich and buttery fish from their home state, but I do think on this night, I’d have to chose the Forget-Me-Hopped from Double Shovel (and Pat agrees).",

        "Body": "Today is my best friend’s birthday and it has made me ponder what goes into a perfect pairing that lasts for 27 years and counting?  There are the obvious characteristics of good friendship: someone who can make you laugh, someone you enjoy spending time with and someone with whom you gave up false pretenses years ago and who you can feel at ease with while being your true, authentic self. These make for a sweet, fun pair. But a best friend is also someone who can ask you probing and penetrating questions. They can find the right way to warn you when they know you are making a bad decision. They can also persuade you to dare for new heights and push you beyond your comfort zone to really reach for what only seems possible in unspoken dreams. This sometimes means the friendship gets a little prickly, but it makes for a truer pairing. <br><br> So in honor of those perfect prickly paired friendships, I have decided to compare two prickly pear ciders today. (And somewhat serendipitously when I was travelling last month to see my best friend and we celebrated his birthday, he picked up one of these prickly pear ciders for me to try, because he knows me so well) Tonight I look at the only two prickly pear ciders I know of, Mountain West’s Desolation Prickly Pear and Incline’s Prickly Pear. Like best friends, they are unique individuals but share important things at their core. In this case they both highlight the \"main\" ingredient of prickly pear but are two totally different ciders catering to two different cider crowds, or two different moods if you are an omnivorous cider drinker like me. (Though prickly pear is the promoted fruit flavor, I am not suggesting that it is actually the main ingredient or most prominent flavor in either cider) <br><br> The calm claret color of Incline is more inviting to me, though the Desolation, with its livelier bubbles and a light straw color (where is the promised pinkish hue?) and sharp nose is plenty attractive. Desolation is much dryer and acidic. It is almost wine-like, and the flavor is dominated by its long, dry, tart-to-sour, finish. Incline, on the other hand, is smoother, fruity and more tropical (and obviously sweeter). <br><br> One of them, then, is more serious, borderline sour at times, but incredibly interesting and full of depth if you are willing to slow down and listen. So, what do you want this night? Something to sit and ponder with? Or are you up for a bit of fruity fun that is carefree and will make you laugh and forget things for bit?  In my opinion, both are essential to a good friendship, and maybe a good drink. In fact, you may want and need both in a single night.

        "Body": "With such beautiful soils and a cool climate in western Montana, it should be no surprise that Montana is starting to produce excellent ciders. (While Last Chance is in Billings, their cherries are sourced from the western part of the state) Today I am trying to cherry offerings from two of the most successful cideries in the state, and neither disappoints! To break the two down: Flathead has a deeper color—a deeper, heavier, everything really—and to my nose a more inviting and stronger flavor of sour cherries. The Flathead is not only heavier, but it is fuller bodied, stronger, more rustic and its cherry taste is more robust and sour than Sour Cherry. However, Western Cider’s Sour Cherry is a real cider drinker’s delight. It is stiller and smoother with a more sustained flavor throughout all phases. Sour Cherry is more tannic and drier, all while maintaining its flavor. <br><br> In choosing a winner my choice is for Sour Cherry because it is so clean, smooth and refreshing yet dry and complex. It really is excellent. Last Chance is very good and if you are looking for something more rustic, more hardy, more stereotypically Montana, then this might be your drink. However, if you want the new, more modern, Montana that retains some of its hardy mountain man roots, but is a bit more polished yet ruggedly sophisticated, go for the Western Cider. It is perfectly balanced with a little bit of tartness and natural grit, as well as a bit of charm and sophistication—smooth, fruity and intriguing. You’ll want another.",

        "ID": 79,
        "Body": "Most of the perries I’ve had before have come from the East Coast or Midwest with a couple from Colorado and California, and even one from Europe, but I decided to have my first tastes of Pacific Northwest perries come all in one sitting and this has been a unique flight of drinks. None of these are your traditional light and sweet fleshy soft pear ciders. Instead, two are farmhouse style and one is a heavy imperial. <br><br> First, breaking down the basics: Pearadise has a pale gold color and looks like every other semi-sweet draft cider out there, where the Pearfect Session has a cloudy pale straw color and Perry just looks like fresh-squeezed lemonade—yum! The best aroma, though, clearly goes to Pearadise which is rich with both pear and tropical fruits. The other two are more sour and acidic in smell and Pearfect session has a musty melon aroma which isn’t exactly inviting. Looking at just the two farmhouse perries for a moment, the Double Mountain is what a farmhouse perry should taste like and is an example of how to do a farmhouse perry, where Pearfect Session is an example of how not to do a farmhouse perry. The drink is too dry when mixed with the strong levels of acidic taste which completely burn off any delicate pear flavor. On the other hand, even though the Double Mountain was dry and had created a small burn at the back of the throat, you still got plenty of the fruit flavor, tartness, and a delicate finish of pears and honey. Yes, it had that natural raw essence, but it was still very very drinkable. Finally, the Pearadise, in a category of its own—I’ve never had an imperial-style perry either—has the most flavor, it is the most complex, and it has the most going on. You get hit with all these different flavor profiles, but then they all gel really well together with an interesting thick, almost syrupy, and most definitely tannic, mouthfeel. Then at the very end you get a finishing note of poached pears reminding you of what you’ve ordered. <br><br> In making a decision, I have to say that I love the idea of a perry farmhouse. I don’t know if there are others out there, but leave it to the clever Cascadians to try it out. Obviously, one worked out better than the other. Choosing between the Double Mountain and the 2 Towns Imperial Pear is tricky because I scored them the same, they are two different styles and neither really focuses on a traditional sweet pear flavor. So, as is no surprise if you’ve read many comparative lit essays on this website you know it comes down to mood and personal preference. Do you like the tang of a good sidra? Looking to pair fish with a natural drink? Then go with the Double Mountain. I’m really impressed by this drink. But if you want to slow down and sit in your most comfortable chair (leather wingback or otherwise) this imperial makes for an excellent session drink. The nose is incredible and there is so much going on that this epitomizes the Sophisticated Night In, but for the first time (for me) it is a <span class=\"feebackItalic\">perry</span> that is deep, contemplative, and serious. My vote goes to the serious and sophisticated perry.",

        "Body": "If there is one thing Oregonians are proud of it is their beloved marionberries—a blackberry variety developed at Oregon State University. Any Oregonian will tell you this is the superior strand of blackberry. Right or wrong, tonight I have three blackberry ciders that are not merely blackberry, but all brag about being <span class=\"feebackItalic\">marion</span>berry ciders. So how do these Pacific Northwest ciders breakdown: <br><br> Swift has the best nose that is rich and jammy, whereas Seattle’s nose is lighter, and Incline has an interesting hoppy lemongrass aroma. Seattle also has the lightest mouthfeel and a fresh blackberry taste. Even though the flavor profile only has one note, it does give you the clearest blackberry flavor of the three. Incline is the most complex of the three as it goes beyond tart blackberry and gives you an earthy sour taste. The flavor really builds in your mouth and intensifies all that is going on. Finally, Swift is the darkest and stillest (with a light-to-medium body though) and is the driest of the lot. <br><br> In choosing a winner, all are great, and I recommend all of them. Seattle is the lightest and fruitiest and if you’re looking for a sweet drink that has a straightforward blackberry taste, try this lighter cider that has a great balance of sweet and tart. It is the most refreshing of the three. The Incline is excellent and the most complex and interesting of the flight and would do well on a cold night sitting by the fire, when you still want something slightly sweet and tangy to accompany you after a long day. And this is especially the drink for you if you like sour beers. But, finally, my choice is the Swift Oregon Marionberry. I went with this cider not just because it is from Oregon and it may be sacrilegious to allow a Washingtonian win the marionberry contest—Marion County is in central Oregon after all and Washington is just trying to glam on to its success and name recognition—but because Swift has a natural simplicity that is still and very mildly earthy, it takes me away to the Cape Falcon trail in Oswald West State Park. There the thick blackberry bushes on either side of the path produce a planty fragrance and juicy ripe blackberries while the ocean mist gently reminds you you’re on the coast. It is not showy, but deep, rich and simple. A little taste of Oregon in a bottle. Cheers to Oregon. Cheers to the marionberry. And cheers to Swift for making an outstanding blackberry cider!",

        "Body": "It is perry time again—lucky me—and tonight I have two Mountain West cideries (Sandia of New Mexico and Wild Cider of Colorado) taking on the regional/national powerhouse (Original Sin) from New York. I will say from the beginning that none of these three perries completely captured the essence of the pear—that perfectly soft, fleshy, juicy sweetness of a pear. I am not saying that perry has to be sweet, but you want the pear character to shine through. <br><br> Comparing the three, the Wild Cider probably has the best glass appeal with a gold color that is sharper than the muted gold of Sandia and more inviting than Original Sin’s drink which is pale with a tinge of green. Wild Cider has the sweetest nose, but the Sandia is more inviting with its interesting peach aroma. Wild Cider is crisper, lighter and sharper than the other two. Sandia is thicker to the point of being heavy, and quite viscous like some fresh tropical juices. It is also very still. On the other end of the spectrum is Original Sin which is over carbonated, and the body is too light and on the edge of being watery. It is also trying to be a dry cider, but the candied taste of the pears they use does not seem to match. <br><br> Again, none of these are perfect as they each have their flaws, but some are more egregious than others. The historical anecdote about the oldest grafted pear tree in colonial New Amsterdam and exceptional can art had me excited about Original Sin. But it was just inferior to the other two in every area. Technically, it is the driest of the three, but with that candied note at the end, it tastes off. It lacks the nuance to be a great dry. It’s fine, but that is it. While not as bad as Original Sin, the Wild Cider also feels off balance and has a lackluster mouthfeel. The winner of the three has to be Sandia. Though it is not very crisp and a bit too heavy, it is the most balanced of the three and brings an interesting peachy flavor that is unusual for a perry—but it works pretty well and is very good. There are superior perries out there that better capture the essence of a pear, but if you find yourself in central New Mexico, check out this ciderhouse. Their pear is bold, very juicy and a good mix of tart and sweet.",

One of these cranberry ciders come from a new cidery in Ft. Collins, Colorado (a town more known for its beer) and the other from Bishop Cider Co., the top cider maker in Dallas that you can find all over the DFW metro area, including the Ballpark in Arlington. (We’ll see if the new Globe Life Field will carry it once fans are allowed in again) But enough baseball, let’s talk cider. <br><br> In comparing the two, the most obvious place to start is that the Crackberry includes both cranberry and blackberry which makes it darker in the glass. There is more going on in the Crackberry nose which is tart, acidic, a bit stemmy and has a hint of fermentation. There is also a lot more going on with the taste as it has a richer berry flavor and a fruity finish. Though the drink doesn’t give you much taste in the first phase—and the Climb Harder has a pretty strong acidic first taste—several things start to happen in the Crackberry after that, which also has the better mouthfeel of the two. <br> I think then the nod goes to Crackberry as there is just more pushing this drink to the front of the line. It is smooth around the edges and is clearly the more refined and polished of the two. I also think the more earthy blackberry both cuts the tartness a bit and adds an element missing in the more monotone Climb Harder offering which is more acidic and tart. If it is just a good pucker you are after, maybe the Cranberry is your drink, but if you want a more refined drink that is both fruity and sophisticated, make your way up to the ballpark, the southwest hipster part of Dallas to their tasting room, or wherever else you can find Crackberry. Ignore the man on the can mooning you and just drink it down—it’s really good!",

And now two cider makers have tried capturing the great outdoors in a can by literally putting the woods in the can—Skacksbury with the juniper-inspired Vermonter, and Colorado Cider Company with a special spruce-infused drink. I felt like to get the full experience I would need to take both of these in while in the woods, campfire roaring with smoke wafting about and getting in my eyes. If we start with first appearances, then it was love at first sight for the Vermonter. I’m a sucker for matte black cans, and this simple Vermonter design is poppin—love it! So the artwork advantage goes to Shacksbury, but how else do they compare? <br> Both of these drinks have an inviting aroma—a peach nose with the Spruced and a fruitier, lighter smell with the Vermonter, which I preferred. The bubblier Vermonter has a touch of sweetness in the taste and is slightly drier (semi-dry) than the Spruced, which is heavier bodied and just on this side of sweet. The Vermonter had the stronger woods taste of the two—and Spruced had a bit of an artificial woodsy taste. I preferred the first phase of Spruced better as well as the tartness it had in the finish. However, the tree taste was less jarring in Vermonter and overall it was the more drinkable of the two. <br> In crowning a winner, I have to give the evergreen wreath to the Vermonter for the last comparison point—it is just more drinkable. Let’s face it, these are both novelty drinks and neither is going to be your everyday drinker and I’m guessing neither Colorado Cider nor Shacksbury has plans of making this their flagship cider anytime soon. It also means that unlike many of my other comparative lit reviews, there is very little difference in mood. Both of these are only if you’re heading camping and looking for something on theme to impress friends, outside that, I’m not sure I’d recommend these and especially not to new cider drinkers. Adventurers only. But both are fairly drinkable and if the great outdoors is calling, consider taking either of these woodsy ciders along.",

While the East Coast and Pacific Northwest have long been powerhouses of the American cider scene, over the last decade a number of cider houses have sprung up in the Mountain West where wild swings in temperature and dry valleys at the feet of mountain ranges have created some really interesting and unique ciders. Colorado, Montana, Idaho, Utah, New Mexico, and now Wyoming, all now boast of quality cider houses, which means your trip out west just got tastier. In fact, I can’t think of a better beverage companion for a summer road trip than some cold cider to enjoy at your destination. So today, as I enjoy my own trip, I brought along two mountain-inspired flagship ciders from western states to see which better captured the sprit of the Mountain West— Farmstead’s Mountain Dry (The apples are sourced from Jackson Hole just to the south of Grand Teton National Park)and Mountain West Cider’s 7 Mile Session (named after the beautiful rugged and red canyon just to the west of Arches National Park). <br> Immediately upon pouring you can see that the two drinks are very different. 7 Mile is nearly clear, one of the clearest ciders I’ve ever seen, where Mountain Dry looks like a super bubbly Country Time lemonade. I preferred the 7 Mile nose which was light, airy and a bit tart, over the smell of Mountain Dry which was much more acidic. The bodies of these two drinks were also incredibly different as 7 Mile is super light and very dry and only has a little lingering tartness in the finish, otherwise there is not a ton of flavor and it’s style is best described as a light cider. The Farmstead on the other hand has a much thicker body and significantly higher levels of acidity. This is more akin to a farmhouse or Spanish sidra with a little bit of funkiness from the acetic acid. While it is undeniably strong, and will give you a bit of tingle in the back of the throat, it does not go overboard with the acid like some scrumpy and is definitely still drinkable. <br> Both of these ciders are quite good and thus in choosing a winner it really comes down to your mood, and maybe what you want to get out of your summer vacation. The 7 Mile is incredibly mellow, maybe too mellow, and does not pack much of a punch when it comes to flavor. However, its smoothness is ideal if you just want to relax and enjoy the sun. The Mountain Dry, on the other hand, is a lot more vigorous and maybe even a bit rough. So are you the kind of person who likes to enjoy the mountains while sitting and sunning on a beautiful lake; or are you the adventurous type who is up for a long and strenuous in order to earn your views? While I do enjoy a hammock at the lake—and very much liked the mellow 7 Mile—I prefer a good hike and today I am going with the hardy, yet refreshing, Mountain Dry.",

I hope you’ve had your share of dribble-down-the-chin moments with fresh peaches this summer, but if you haven’t I have three peach ciders that can be enjoyed beyond the bounds of summer if you can find a bottle or can online or at your local. They come from the three northwestern-most states in the US—Washington (Incline’s White Peach), Montana (Western’s Whiskey Peach), and Oregon (Bauman’s Peach Bellini)—which I don’t typically think of as peach states, but they are definitely cider states so let’s let them make their case. And even though they are all peach flavored, the creativity of the cidermakers is on show as all three are incredibly different and hopefully the diversity of peach ciders will produce something perfect for you. <br> In breaking them down, the White Peach has the best glass appeal with its deep blurry gold color where the Bellini and Whiskey are more standard straw and pale gold colors. The Incline also has the strongest aroma, a deep peach flavor amplified by the hops. Western’s nose clearly smells of old whiskey barrels with some peachiness, but I actually preferred the smell of the Bellini which was slightly sweet and very inviting. The Bellini is clearly the sweetest of the three with Incline the driest. Whiskey Peach probably has the most peach flavor, but it is competing against the smokiness of the whiskey—which wins out as this beverage drinks more like a spirit than a cider. Though Incline has a deep peach aroma, the taste really drops out in the middle phase and the finish is marked by a slightly sour and bitter taste. In this case the hops have overpowered the delicate peach flavor. The Bellini is most like cider of the three and probably has the best mouthfeel and is the easiest to drink. <br> All of these were good, though none were truly excellent. (Although, maybe I just have a bias against peach ciders?) Even though the Western is technically the best—it’s innovative, well-crafted and earned the highest grade—in choosing the right cider of the three for you, it will come down to your mood as they are all so diverse. Incline’s White Peach is a good drink, but it doesn’t completely come together in a special way. It is not a bad peach cider, but got blown too far off course with the particular hops used. When it comes to the other two, which are very good to outstanding, they can not be more different. Bellini is light, airy and sweet and tastes more like an apple cider. It is kind of like watching a light-hearted comedy show on a Friday night after a long hard week—something simple, fun and easy before bed. On the other hand, Whiskey Peach is a proper drink. Stiff. While the peach is a nice fruity balance and contrast with the clear notes of whiskey and smokiness, you need to be in the mood for a serious drink. And though the world seems to be pressing down on my shoulders at the moment, or maybe be because of it, tonight, I just want the Bellini. May you find the peach cider that best suits your occasion.",

        "ID": 86,
        "Body": "Southern Spain and the Italian Peninsula are undoubtedly better known for their wine than their cider, however, Northern Spain has one of the longest and richest cider traditions in the world, and there are currently at least three Italian cidermakers, all in the north near or in the mountains. In one random historical instance the two towns where these two ciders hail from—San Sebastian (The Good Cider) and just north of Trento (Angioletti)—fought together to defeat the League of Cognac! While it would better fit the theme if this were a league of powerful wine makers attempting to stomp on the little man, but alas the War Against the League of Cognac (1526-1530) was when several powerful kingdoms and republics including France, England, Navarre, Venice, Florence, Genoa and the Papal States made a pact to lessen the power of the Habsburg family then in control of the Holy Roman Empire which included much of central Europe, the Italian Peninsula and what is now Spain.  This was part of the larger Italian Wars (1494-1559) of the Renaissance period in Europe. During this time the people of San Sebastian remained very loyal to Charles the V and helped the Spanish Habsburgs put down rebellions and extend their territory into the Kingdom of Navarre. Across the Mediterranean the Pope along with the leaders of Venice, Florence, and Milan attempted to push the Holy Roman Empire out of the Italian Peninsula for good, but to no avail as towns like Trento stayed firmly under Habsburg rule until the First World War. It would be fascinating to know if there were some connection between the two cider regions other than this obscure war, but I have absolutely no historical evidence to prove it. Nonetheless, I will try these two sweeter ciders to see who does it best now. While the more widely known <span class=\"feebackItalic\">sidra natural</span> or traditional Spanish cider is marked by its dry, sour and twangy acidity, there are other methods used in northern Spain that produce sweeter and more approachable ciders as well. <br> In breaking these two ciders down, The Good Cider has a bright nose that smells strongly of sugar. The Angioletti aroma is sweet but comparatively much more mellow. It also has tannic apple skins in the nose. While they look nearly identical in the glass, they do not taste the same at all. The Secco (Dry) has a soft mouthfeel with drying characteristics, yet it retains a certain sweet character. While much of the sugar in this cider were fermented out to get that dry mouthfeel, the apple varietals had enough sweet characteristics that it still registers sweet notes despite the drying mouthfeel sensation. Secco does not have a bold flavor but it is crisp with a little bit of acidity and is a good straight forward semi-dry cider. The Good Cider on the other hand is way too sweet. While it is probably tarter than Secco, the acidity and everything else is masked by the sweetness. Even though I often enjoy sweet ciders, this is too much even for me. If it wasn’t naturally sweet enough, they added an additional 16 grams of sugar a bottle, giving this the feeling of a sugary apple juice drink from concentrate. It is too bold, too over the top. If I had to give you a visual image, I would say that the Good Cider is a bright purple Gaudí mansion off La Rambla, whereas Secco is a tasteful villa with a red tiled roof hugging an Alpine lake. While you might like to go and gawk at the surreal gaudy creation, if given the choice, you’d probably take the classy lakeside villa. The Good Cider is too sweet and sugary, if you want to try a southern European cider and have an option, go for the Vero Sidro Italiano and enjoy a nice, subtle, well-crafted cider.",

        "Body": "In many ways blackcurrants are an underappreciated fruit as they are not widely eaten raw, and in the case of the U.S. they aren’t even widely known because they primarily grown in Europe and Oceana. But people there know these small black berries produce a big tart taste and can be found flavoring all sorts of foods. While it is no surprise that Irish Magners would add it to their Berry cider, it is more surprising to see a Texan cider maker feature it so prominently. Indeed, Bishop Cider Company put that tart and astringent flavor more front and center (which I appreciated and enjoyed). <br> In comparing the two, the colors contrast pretty sharply. Berry is a bright bubblegum pink when poured where Bishop’s The Dark Cide is thick, opaque and brooding. If it is blackcurrant you are after it is definitely more prominently featured in the Dark Cide which has a tart, almost bitter, flavor. Magners’ Berry has a light and sweet cordial-like nose with a lighter, smoother mouthfeel. It is really sweet. The Dark Cide is sharper and heavier. After a sharp start the drink really comes alive in the finish with a rich jammy tartness that is well balanced. Even though the finish isn’t long, it gives plenty of tartness. (I also recommend letting this one breathe a bit first to really open up those flavors) <br> The verdict then is in favor of the Dark Cide. At one level doesn’t make much sense because what do Texans know about blackcurrants? But at another level it makes sense because, though not bad, Magners’ Berry is essentially the alcoholic version of a cordial, and you know that no one really loves cordial, but they serve it at events because it is cheap and tastes a bit better and is ever so slightly fancier than serving plain water. (Americans, this is the equivalent of serving Kool-Aid or powdered lemonade at a potluck) So, is Berry nice and drinkable and maybe a tad too sweet? Yes. So, if you want more of a grown up drink and can handle some sophisticated tartness that is simultaneously immature and irreverent, try the Dark Cide.",

        "Body": "There are lots of \"Bloody Sundays\" in history. While a number of them are related to Irish-British troubles going back to the 1880s—including the most famous one referred to in the U2 song—there were a number of Bloody Sundays in North America that involved the repression of striking workers. This list includes attacks against striking steelworkers in Nova Scotia in 1923,  unemployment protestors in Vancouver in 1938 and the famous Everett Massacre which included armed vigilantes pouring hundreds of rounds on a boat full of Wobblies trying to dock in the Seattle suburb, which may be credited for starting a period of labor unrest in the Pacific Northwest. So, in the spirit  of remembering workers history on this American Labor Day weekend, I contribute my review of three blood orange ciders—two Blood Oranges from the two biggest cider makers in Texas, Bishop and Austin Eastciders, and Space Bloody Orange Craft Cider from the California Cider Company. <br> They are all pretty opaque and cloudy with Bishop the darkest and the Space with a thick, dark grapefruit color. Bishop has the strongest orange aroma where Space is more mellow. When it comes to comparing taste, Space is clearly the most unique and is slightly funky. It also has the best mouthfeel which is smooth and fairly thick. Finally, Bishop’s Blood Orange is the driest and sharpest of the three. <br> The two Texas ciders are more straightforward orange-flavored ciders, and of the two, the Austin Eastcider is just better. It’s rounder, more well balanced, and with a smoother and stronger flavor. So, after that, it comes down to the Austin Blood Orange and Space. Both are great in their own right, and it depends on what you want. Do you want something more conservative with a straightforward orange flavor and a fair amount of citric acid and tartness? Or do you dabble in the funky and are willing to try something more unusual? Going back to the Bloody Sundays of history, historians often seek to uncover new angles or evidence that lead to more complex interpretations of the past. Space is like the unexpected variable that complicates our understanding of how to interpret the past. While there are a number of blood orange ciders out there [which Incline’s is probably the best] Space throws in a couple of elements that have us question the standard interpretation of what a blood orange cider should taste like. And I think it is richer and more complex, and thus, tonight, I’ll look to Space as the winner.",

        "Title": "Locational Cider and Terroir Bragging Rights",
        "ID": 89,
        "Body": "One of the most interesting developments in cider production has been the advent (or return to?) locational ciders, focusing not so much on particular varietals, but on using uncultivated apples from a particular location and seeing what the local terroir produces. And no one has drawn more attention to the locational cider concept than Andy Brennan of Aaron Burr Ciders. Well, a new small cider outfit in Jackson Hole, Wyoming has imbibed much of Andy Brennan’s philosophy and taken it to heart. They have created a new Neighborhood Cider Series that they describe as “made with foraged wild apples, harvested by hand in Jackson Hole and surrounding communities. Every neighborhood orchard has a unique assemblage of apple varieties that produce one-of-a-kind ciders with their own unique terroir.” Their Rafter J is a blend of untreated apples from a particular mature neighborhood (Rafter J) with at least one wild tree of unknown age (reminiscent of the Denniston Red in Brennan’s book), so it seemed right to compare them side-by-side. In some way, then, this is less about comparing methods—as both are foraging for untreated, uncultivated and in some cases wild apple trees—and more about terroir—the environment, soils and biomes that have produced these apples (and crabapples). So, in a sense it is a comparison of the communities in which they are grown. One comes from just north of the most grand and impressive city of North America, and the other comes from a small neighborhood just south of the most grand and impressive mountain range in North America. So how do they compare? <br> In the glass the Taconic is hazier with a richer golden hue. Rafter J has a more acidic nose that is slightly funky but still somewhat subdued, where Taconic has bitter tannins in the nose which segues into a slightly bitter tannic taste. The main feature of both these drinks is their finish. While Rafter J has a substantial amount of acidity hitting the back of the palate during the middle phase, it finishes with interesting subtleties in the finish. Similarly, Taconic really opens up in the final phase with an incredibly delicate and soft finish after a larger, and more alcoholic, first phase. Taconic also has a minerality quality to it that is unique and has a softer mouthfeel that allows the depth of flavors to come forward. <br> Maybe I’m a romantic, maybe I just want to believe in this locational cider concept, but I do love these ciders and I love that they are not a single varietal, which let’s face it, have to be created in an artificial grafting process. I also love it because it is more natural, more sustainable, and potentially has a smaller impact on our environment. But at the end of the day, I’m a cider critic and I have to give a grade, choose a winner and loser, and help guide you to the cider that’s best for you. And though I am primarily a Mountain West kind of guy who also loves the city, I have to go with Taconic. In large part because you get to experience the subtleties of the terroir more because it is not competing with the big shot of acidity you get in Rafter J. There may be just as many levels to the flavor of the apples coming from New York, but you get to experience them longer and more fully with the softer mouthfeel and less abrasive Taconic. I will admit that I did not enjoy Taconic quite as much as I did the first time I tried it (it is one of the highest scoring drinks I’ve ever reviewed) but that could be because of my context (previously I was in an incredible location with some of my favorite people in the world), or it could be because this 4-year old vintage is reaching the end of its shelf live and is starting to lack some of the verve and vigor of its youth. But if any bottles are left of this vintage, or if later years have produced the same depth of flavors, I would snatch up a Taconic as quickly as possible. If you like the funk of a good sidra or feel more connected to the Rocky Mountain soil, drink the Rafter J, otherwise the tantric tannins of Taconic are not to be missed!",

        "Body": "After trying Emerald City alongside a couple of other blackberry ciders, these past two years I have felt confident saying that it is the best blackberry cider I’ve ever had. Well, in going over my notes, I realized that none of its blackberry challengers also had pear, and this shook my confidence. Did Emerald City just always win because it had that extra element? And let’s face it pear and blackberry is a killer combo and the perfect mix of soft and sweet with tart and tangy. So, I needed to make sure it wasn’t just combo bias that Emerald City always came out on top and I wanted to put it to the test by comparing it with another blackberry pear, in this case, also from the Pacific Northwest. So how do they compare? <br> Emerald City is about three shades darker in the glass which I find more appealing over the cranberry colored Voodoo Blackberry. Emerald City also has a deeper nose of blackberries that is earthy and slightly jammy, which, again, I found preferable to the lighter, tarter, nose of cranberries found in the Voodoo. Emerald City is fairly heavy, whereas Voodoo has a lighter body. The Voodoo is smoother, but the Emerald City’s mouthfeel is on point as its tartness and acidity are perfectly balanced. Emerald City also has a more intense blackberry and pear flavor where Voodoo only gives a generically fruity feel without clear blackberry or pear notes. The Voodoo is also pretty sweet which has a slight artificiality to it. There is no doubt Emerald City is also sweet, but it is better balanced with bold flavors. <br> Emerald City then retains its blackberry title. Yes, the blending with pears gives it an added element and advantage over other blackberry ciders in my grade book, but it is still an all around superior drink. In fact, I’m a little sad that I just drank my last Emerald City of the season and now I’ll have to wait like 6 months until they next release it and I can have another. I really wish it was available every season. It truly is excellent.",

        "Body": "It’s Friday tonight and I have an accomplishment worth celebrating this week, so I have grabbed two celebratory brut ciders, from two incredibly respected  cidermakers—Charles McGonegal of ÆppelTreow who consistently makes thoughtful ciders from his orchard in Wisconsin, and Eric Bordelet, a famous Parisian sommelier-turned-cider-maker who turned to a simpler life in northwest France where he has been making cider for almost three decades at this point. If you’re looking for light, bone dry, and bubbly champagne-style cider, neither of these will be quite what you are expecting. In the wine world brut is a term for dryness and usually denotes something with less residual sugar than an \"extra dry\" wine. Subsequently, some American cider makers use the term to designate a champagne-like cider, but the term is used in different ways elsewhere in the cider world. In Normandy \"brut\" also refers to both strength and sweetness, but with a \"cidre brut\" denoting something northwards of 5% alcohol by volume which typically means more of the sugar has been fermented into alcohol. So to French cider speak, and in the case of Eric Bordelet, this brut tendre is in between a tendre or demi-sec (sweet cider) and his full Brut (drier and higher ABV), and is thus more akin to a semi-dry cider. (And to my tongue it falls just to the sweet side of center on the dry-sweet spectrum) As you’ll also see if you read my individual review of Appley Brut (and below), even though it comes in a big green champagne bottle with a nice gold foil top, it is more serious than your traditional light and bubbly champagne cider. <br> In comparing the two, the Sidre Brut has a sweeter nose and softer mouthfeel. Overall, it has a lovely, rich and intense sweet flavor that is tannic and complex and is slightly tarter in taste. The Appley Brut has a tarter and more tannic nose. It is also more alcoholic tasting and heavier. In general, it is more serious and stiffer than the Bordelet. The Appley Brut starts out light and fruity but the finish turns more complex—tannic and slightly earthy. On the other hand, the Sidre Brut has a more consistent profile throughout that is bold and well balanced. <br> These are both great, grab either if you find one, but if you’ve got to chose between the two it will depend on what mood you are in, and maybe even the time of day. If you are looking for something easy drinking during the day, or with a meal, the Eric Bordelet is brilliant. If you’re drinking at night and want something that is light and celebratory, yet slightly complex and a bit more contemplative, it would be hard to find a better drink than the Appley Brut.",

Two of the oldest and most popular are Right Bee Cider (the first and original mom and pop cidery in Chicago) in the Hermosa neighborhood, and 2 Fools of the far west suburb of Naperville, the wealthiest city in the Mid-West and home to the DuPage Riverwalk, lots of white picket fences, chain restaurants, and now a proper ciderhouse from the taste of things. Even though these two cideries are far apart, both are within walking distance of the Metra and I love the idea that you could try both in one day without driving and just a single transfer at Union Station in the West Loop (where you could grab a quick Caribou Coffee for a little pick-me-up in between).  These appear to be the two dry(ish) flagship offerings and the plan is to see which of these two cideries has earned some Chicagoland bragging rights. <br> To compare, both look pretty similar with nearly identical pale straw colors. The noses of both are a bit earthy and neither draws me in, though I’d give a slight edge to 2 Fools. After some time past, the Right Bee mellowed out a bit and the 2 Fools got earthier. The 2 Fools is very dry and astringent and clearly dryer than Right Bee which is neither dry nor with a particularly bold or round sweet flavor. The 2 Fools is also much tarter with a clear green apple flavor that is slightly tannic. <br> Both of these ciders were good, but neither wowed me. I do hope to get back to Chi-Town to try more cider offerings soon. I once lived less than three miles from where Right Bee is now, and I’ve got a ton of love for the old neighborhood and that part of Chicago. So it pains me slightly to say it, but I just preferred the cider from the burbs. Though the bright, tart, green apple flavor seems a little odd with a really dry cider, 2 Fools Dry just had a clearer identity and more cohesion than its semi-dry challenger. Right Bee was kind of a cyser, kind of earthy, kind of dry, kind of sweet and kind of all over the place. Now, maybe you are the kind of person who refuses to take the Metra past Oak Park and only a true Chicago cider will do—fine—Right Bee’s a good cider that will get the job done. But if you like it dry and tart and are willing to go all the way to the end of the BNSF Line and the land of big car dealerships and golf courses, then do so, because the cider is just a little bit better. (Or just go to Binny’s where you can get either ;o)",

        "Body": "Today is the first day of fall and already America has begun changing from green to golden yellow and flaming orange. It’s beautiful in my neck of the woods and I hope it is lovely where you are too. In the cider world this is when orchardists are usually busy harvesting apples. Obviously, it depends on the variety, but in early fall you can count on orchardists and cider makers to be out there picking some of the more unique apples used for cider. So, in honor of those outside picking today, when I have had privilege of sitting inside and enjoying the fall colors, I have chosen three ciders that use heirloom blends. In other words, I have three cideries from across the country who take pride in their own orchards or in the fact that they are able to use heirloom varietals, some of the princes of cider apples, to get unique ciders that showcase the many different attributes apples can bring to cider, or demonstrate how to create a unified whole cider from their favorite varietals. Archibald James of Washington (Heirloom Field Blend) blends their favorites from Fell Orchards. Colorado Cider Company (Heritage Blend) is celebrating the unique characteristics of the third year of growing cider apples in their own orchard in Western Colorado and Vermont-based Eden (Peak Bloom) boasts of using their own apples and those of four other nearby orchards who also claim to use methods of sustainability. In many ways this is cider at its best—no gimmicks, no infusions of other flavors, just master cider makers blending together the best of what that season has to offer in in the neighborhoods where they live. <br> In breaking these three down they all have pretty standard colors, Peak Bloom is light straw, The Field Blend is standard straw, but the Heritage blend has a lovely pale gold color that is the prettiest to my eye. Both the Field Blend and the Heritage Blend have outstanding noses with the former being a bit more acidic with sweet cherries, and the latter is richer, a bit heavy with notes of sour cherries and grapes—and was my favorite. Peak Bloom had an odd cat food smell? When it came to mouthfeel and drinkability the Peak Bloom was the crispest of the three and had some really nice tart notes. The Field Blend was the smoothest and easiest to drink—somewhat surprising for a barrel-aged cider. The Heritage Blend is dryish, but it is hard to categorize because there is sweet in there too. In fact, with its twelve varietals there were many elements at play in the Heritage Blend. <br> In some ways picking a winner here is hard because I am choosing the apples from one region of the country over another, but at the end of the day all these cidermakers had to select and blend the apples and so in a way I am judging decision making and craft. First, while I loved aspects of Eden’s taste, it just can’t be the winner if I have to hold my nose to enjoy it. That leaves the cider from the Western slope of Colorado and Washington state. These are both great ciders! I’m impressed and would be proud to serve either at my home. I like the Heritage Blend better, even though the Heirloom Field Blend is smoother and has a taste like no other. But the Colorado cider really demonstrate all the complexity cider has to offer while retaining an enjoyable, drinkable and pleasant experience. In many ways it provides all the elements of great cider: it’s tannic, sweet, bitter, rich, has a bite of acidity, and enough tartness to make you pucker just a little. Maybe it is overkill to use twelve varietals of apples, but as they say, if you got it, flaunt it. And what Colorado Cider has in their third-year crop is very very good. As fall progresses, and if you can find it, consider serving Heritage Blend this Thanksgiving.",

Both are very good, but very different. And both were diverged from my expectations throughout the session. Golden State’s Mighty Dry is a standard golden straw color that looked like a lighter cider, but then had a nose that was a bit sour, but it then ended up being the fruitier, sharper and sweeter of the two ciders which ran opposite to what its nose was projecting. Apple Outlaw’s Jefferson Dry on the other hand looked like one of those unfiltered farmhouses that can be a bit harsh or funky, but it actually had a fruity and juicy noise—which I preferred over the Mighty Dry. The taste was far from a rough farmhouse as it was lighter and more mellow than its competitor with a bit of a citrus flavor and just a hint of bitterness adding complexity. In many ways Jefferson Dry reminds me of the woods—grey and a bit cold but nice, dry and natural. Jefferson Dry would go best paired with a meal, maybe some fresh caught fish. Even though I scored Jefferson Dry a half a point higher, I think I’d rather have Mighty Dry. The dry mouthfeel allows the bright and tart flavors to really come through and this is great as a stand-alone drink or with a heavier meal. Both are great and worth checking out.",

It is kind of like Harvard and MIT, always considered two of the best universities in the world, often spoken in the same breath, and physically separated by only a mile of Mass Ave; and yet they are very different kinds of institutions with different missions. Having spent time on both campuses I can also tell you that there isn’t a ton of love lost between the two, either. It is similar with apples and the big citrus fruits: oranges, lemons, and most prominently in our case today, limes. (Though Saint Citron uses lemon zest and kumquats to support its exotic black Persian limes) There haven’t been many successful attempts to mix citrus with apple cider, the exceptions being some great grapefruit ciders and some mimosa-inspired ciders that aren’t bad. There are also other lime ciders out there too, I mean, it is tempting because what says \"summer treat\" better than a Florida Key Lime pie? Both of the cider makers in the spotlight tonight have decided to dabble with citrus and see if they can’t make limes and apples play nice—St. Vrain’s Key Lime and Rev. Nat’s Saint Citron. <br> Interestingly these both have spice notes in the nose, ginger for Saint Citron, cinnamon for Key Lime though the overall smell of Saint Citron is more intriguing. I do probably find the slightly hazy orangey gold color of the Citron more appealing than the standard straw of Key Lime as well. If I had to ascribe moods to each drink, Key Lime would be very excited, positive and cheery, and \"here’s some key lime pie, ain’t it swell?\" Whereas the Saint Citron is more moody, emotional, and intellectual. Saint Citron pitches itself as a summer drink, and while this may be as lighthearted and carefree as Nat West gets, and though it is somewhat smooth with sweet notes, this is not an easy drinking cider. It is heavier than Key Lime and it is not straightforward, but again nothing with Nat West ever is. On the other hand, the Key Lime has done a good job creating the essence of a key lime pie especially with the cinnamon aroma where you feel like a you’re getting that graham cracker crust in liquid form. <br> In deciding which one is for you, you have to know what you want. There is no doubt the Rev. Nat’s is the more carefully crafted and thoughtful cider (his search for finding exotic fruits is always impressive), but if you want something light-hearted and are okay with sweet, then try the St. Vrain. But if you want to explore the many complexities of citrus, and see sides of the lime family you didn’t know existed, try Saint Citron. Just don’t go in expecting fruity, sweet and fun.",

        "ID": 96,
        "Body": "I once was in an Irish pub in County Tipperary shooting some pool with my mate, and as the red and yellow balls were cracking around the table this old local culchie starts chatting me up. Seeing that I had a cider, he told me that beer was an imperialist drink. Did I know that they had been drinking cider in Ireland for over 1000 years and that hops aren’t even native to the island? In fact, he argued that cider was the drink of true republicans and freedom fighters because the Irish homelands could produce all their cider locally without relying on British supply chains needed for making beer. Clearly this Irish nationalist took a lot of pride in the Irish cider tradition. Now, I can not back up the veracity of the above story with any historical evidence—so take it for what it is—but it got me thinking: I should do a comparative review to see which I like better, English or Irish cider, and to find out if all that Irish cider nationalistic bravado could stand up in a taste test. So, I got my hands on an expensive Irish import, O’Callahan’s Irish Cider, and a bottle from one of the most influential English cidermakers, Tom Oliver’s Traditional Cider. For kicks and giggles I threw in a Magners because that is the most readily available cider here in America, and an American wannabe cider claiming to be an “English-Style Dry Apple Cider,” (Reveille’s King’s Cross). Time to see how they compare: <br> It was interesting that all but the American cider had a copper hue to them which was unusual. Both the O’Callaghan’s and the Oliver’s were dead still and the Oliver’s had a subtle, deep nose that I found the most appealing of the four. The Magner’s was the bubbliest, most acidic, and had far more life and flavor than either O’Callaghan’s or Oliver’s. In fact, both of the two top shelf ciders lacked life. The Irish one was flat with just the tiniest amount of farmhouse funk and spiciness, slightly medicinal and with a small amount of sweetness in the finish, and Oliver’s mouthfeel was so watery that I couldn’t get any of the promised spiciness and oakiness, just some interesting bitter tannins. The King’s Cross was dry and crisp with just enough flavor to make it pop a little in the finish. <br> In choosing a winner, I have to be honest and say that both the expensive imports were disappointing. Both lacked life and maybe something was lost crossing the Atlantic (bad crown cap?) and so I’ll have to try and give them another shot in the future. Thus, I find myself choosing between the Magner’s and the American, King’s Cross. I swear I am not taking a piss, but of the four I like the American best—if I’d known this would be the winner, I’d have left it out of the comparison! While I do enjoy Magners, more than the average cider critic, King’s Cross just has that hearty dry bitterness that reminds me of English drinking sessions in a pub. And as I write a rugby match is coming on in two minutes and this is what I want by my side regardless of whatever yarn some old Irish yokel has spun, or the price tag of my two top shelf imports. So, I don’t yet have a  definitive answer as to who makes better cider—the English or the Irish—but I’m gonna keep drinking and doing more research.",

        "ID": 97,
        "Body": "For over three decades the Mountain West has been best known for craft beer, but more recently distilleries and cideries from the region have been racking up medals. Combining the two newer traditions of the Mountain West today are two barrel-aged ciders: one from Utah, Mountain West’s Stillwater, and one from Colorado, Clear Fork’s Oak Barrel. <br> When comparing the two, the Clear Fork has a better nose and more glass appeal. Its cloudy pale gold color is quite handsome with a smell of warm applesauce. Stillwater has a straightforward straw color and smells more like a gentleman’s drink. While both have clear flavor notes from the barreling, Clear Fork is definitely more balanced with enough sweetness to make it drinkable even though it is quite dry. Stillwater on the other hand is a weird mix of tangy and smoky and uses tart apples that don’t seem to mix well with the whiskeyesque features. It is only good for sipping and seems to have a bit of an identity crisis as it is not really a tart apple cider and its light body means it doesn’t really work as a mock spirit. <br> Choosing a winner in this case is straight forward as Oak Barrel is really good whereas even though Stillwater is fine, it seems a misfire. I have no issue with them going all in on a definite whiskey flavor and higher ABV, I’m just not sure it worked in this case. I think the varietal (or maybe the apple juice?) selection was wrong. An intense tangy sweetness was totally out of character for this drink and the mouthfeel wasn’t quite right. They just didn’t pull it off. If you are looking for a heavy whiskey-like cider, I’d recommend Stem’s 5-String Banjo or Western’s Whiskey Peach instead. While the Clear Fork option doesn’t have the whiskey-like essence you may be after, it is a very good cider with enough oakiness to feel like a barrel-aged drink, but it is still pleasurable to drink. So, this round has to go to the cidermaker that looks west to the mountains instead of the one that looks east.",

        "Body": "I am primarily a reviewer of apple cider and so I need to say this carefully—there is nothing like a great perry. In search of the best, I have gotten my hands on two of Europe’s most respected cider and perry makers—Eric Bordelet of France (Poiré Authentique) and Tom Oliver of England (Herefordshire Perry)—and for good measure I threw in a bottle of Art + Science’s Pilfered Pear made from foraged Oregonian pears because I had one of their ciders last summer and loved it. While many Americans love the light sweet fleshy pear flavor—these three many not be what you are expecting. So let’s break them down: <br> The most attractive in the glass is the Herefordshire Perry with its rich pale gold color, whereas Pilfered Pear has a light straw color with a hint of cloudiness and the Poiré Authentique is a standard golden straw color. The best aroma though definitely goes to the French perry as it has a clear aroma of light sweet pears with maybe a hint of must, where the other two smell pretty acidic and strong. The nose of the Herefordshire option is slightly sulfidic and metallic, and though not completely off putting, it is not for the faint of heart either. It should be no surprise that the acidic noses of the Pilfered Pear and Herefordshire Perry translated to very acidic drinks. The English perry does provide some fruit notes in the middle but is dominated throughout by the acidity and its acidic burn lasts longer than Pilfered Pear which is more like a Spanish sidra with that acidic twang and is way more sour than Oliver’s. Comparatively, the French perry is much lighter than the other two with clear pear notes that are not masked by acidity. It is a bit tart with a slight amount of sweetness and a mouthfeel that is characterless. <br> In assessing the three drinks I will start with the two farmhouse-style perries, neither of which had enough character to be memorable beyond their strong acidic natures. Choosing between the two I give the slight edge to Art + Science. If you are a lover of bold and rough farmhouses or sidras, these may be for you, but I would argue that there are better apple versions out there that bring much more character and nuance. (I also think Double Mountain’s Perry is a better than both of these) Otherwise, there are just more times I’d rather have the Eric Bordelet. Though it didn’t have a ton of personality it was much more drinkable than the other two and would pair well with lots of food options. While it didn’t quite live up to the large expectations I put on it (I was hoping it would change my life and I’d become a pear orchardist and move to France to learn at the feet of Bordelet), it is still a great crisp and tart perry that I’d buy again, even if it wasn’t the best I’ve ever had.",

        "ID": 99,
        "Body": "The Golden Russet apple may be America’s greatest contribution to the cider world. Though Americans sometimes get eye-rolled for using dessert apples in cider, I can tell you that this heirloom varietal originating from upstate New York some 200 years ago has just about everything you could want in an apple in order to make \"proper cider.\" It has a high sugar content which is ideal for robust alcohol content and sufficient sweetness levels, it is tart and acidic, aromatic and fleshy, and has a beautiful skin color. (Well, many American consumers think the russet color is ugly and thus they are rarely used now for eating apples) Instead of trying three ciders from the traditional homelands of the Golden Russet in the American Northeast, tonight I am trying three offerings from cideries in the Rocky Mountain West who appear to take their apples very seriously. All of these cideries apples are sourced from orchards that specialize in cider apples. Snow Capped’s history stems from over a century of growing fruit in Colorado, where Western Cider in Montana decided to plant their own trees a few years ago on their estate—I don’t know what it means that my bottle came from \"rootstock #9\", but the fact that they track these things demonstrates that they take this seriously. Of the three options tonight, only Haykin’s Golden Russet (also from Colorado) is a true single varietal cider where they use nothing but Golden Russet apples. Western’s Russet Blend is blended with other russeted varietals and Snow Capped’s Gold Rush has blended in other cider apples like Ashmead’s Kernal which is closely related to the Golden Russet. I will say from the outset that all three are fantastic and I am now a firm believer that the Golden Russet is just a better apple for cider making than pretty much anything else out there. <br> So to break down these three drinks more concretely they all have golden hues—Haykin is the lightest with a golden straw color, Western has a lovely pale gold color where the Gold Rush has a deep gold glow that I find the most attractive of the three. I also think Gold Rush has the best nose as it is tannic, rich and sweet. The Russet Blend is intriguing with musty and sour notes whereas the Golden Russet’s nose is slightly solvent, though that is covered up by a bright citric acidic aroma. Gold Rush has a big round fruity taste with some sweetness. It then turns tart followed by some tannic bitterness at the end. A very bold cider with seemingly the right amount of everything. Haykin is the most complex of the three, as well as the brightest and most acidic. Haykin’s Golden Russet also has unexpected tropical notes of passionfruit and grapefruit that is somehow jammy and sweet, and tart and bitter at the same time. Finally, Western’s Russet Blend is the most still, the heaviest and driest of the three. It has a buttery nose and mouthfeel and the character of a proper drink with a bit of an old man feel. <br> I know I am supposed to be a critic, but these are all fantastic! Maybe this was a foregone conclusion as Golden Russets are just destined to make great ciders that are complex, slightly sweet and very drinkable. All three of these fit that description in different ways and each should be loved and cherished. However, that does puts me in the impossible position of claiming a winner. More importantly, though, I want you to find the best Golden Russet-inspired cider for your evening. I think the Gold Rush is probably best if you are transitioning from standard semi-sweet ciders to farmhouse ciders or more sophisticated drinks. This is complex but still sweet and easy to drink—in fact, I could down these all night. If I were having a contemplative drinking session alone or with a friend or two the Western would be an excellent choice as it is the most serious of the three. I guess, however, if you were looking to lighten the mood, and who isn’t in 2020, Haykin has a bit more fun and whimsy. It is bright, sharp, tropical, and much more perky than you might expect a Golden Russet cider to be. So, it gets my vote tonight, but all are excellent.",

        "Body": "American Thanksgiving is upon us and many cider aficionados will tell you that cider undoubtedly goes better with turkey than beer. Indeed, for decades the pilgrims and their descendants most prominently drank cider from their own orchards with their wild turkey they shot—and rarely beer. But I know many 21st century Americans drink beer with Turkey Day so I would like to promote a compromise by reviewing three hopped ciders to try and entice beer drinkers into transitioning to something new this year. (Though I readily admit that other ciders which use only crisp apple varietals with a nice dry finish probably go better with white meat than a hopped cider) I have one from Rev. Nat West—one of the most innovative American cider makers who I am thankful for—Cottonwood Dry Hopped Cider from Utah and a hopped Kiwi option (Zeffer’s) that has recently found more shelf space in America. I think the closest thing to Thanksgiving in New Zealand is Waitangi Day or Treaty Day which I am not sure all Maoris are thankful for, but I think Thanksgiving is about (hopefully) putting politics to the side for a day and just enjoying the bounty of the country with friends and family. So, in that spirit let’s compare these three ciders and see how they fare. <br> All three present well in the glass with Cottonwood having a pale straw color, the Zeffer is pale gold, and the Rev. Nat’s Shoot the Glass has a pale amber hue. The Zeffer clearly has the hoppiest nose of the three and Rev. Nat’s has a more mellow aroma that is deep and slightly foreboding, whereas the Cottonwood had a surprisingly sweet nose of cherries which was the most enticing to my nostrils. The Cottonwood was also clearly the driest of the three and had just a hint of earthiness. It was no surprise that the Zeffer had the hoppiest taste, but it was also the most vibrant of the three with the boldest flavor that had clear tropical tones. Overall, it was probably the most well-balanced cider. Shoot the Glass is probably the heaviest option with very little hops flavor and just a hint of spices. Compared to other Rev. Nat creations, this is less exotic with a more straightforward tart apple flavor and a bit of bitterness that builds towards the finish. <br> So yes, they’re all hoped ciders, but they are fairly different. So then, what’s your mood? The Rev. Nat’s is a mellow drink that is probably the most versatile and would be easy to drink at just about any occasion. Zeffer is very bold and you need to be in the mood for big flavor and maybe something fragrant and rich to eat with it to match the intensity. Even though I scored Zeffer higher, I guess tonight I will choose the winner based on which would go best with my dry turkey breast and cranberry sauce on Thursday. The crisp, super dry Cottonwood with tart finish seems like it would best complement a Thanksgiving feast. So, turn on the Macy’s Parade, cheer for your favorite dog at Westminster, eat too much, have a couple of these, and then fall asleep watching football. Wassail!",

As a reminder of what awesome gems you might stumble across by stopping by your local cidery, I share with you two drinks I was lucky to grab recently just by checking in with a cidery. The first is Red Canyon Nan from Farmstead Cider in Jackson, Wyoming. I happened to pop in after a long day of bottling and the guys generously offered me a freshly filled bottle to take home (I needed to wait a bit to open it for more bottle conditioning). This is the most mellow farmhouse cider from Farmstead I’ve tried, and it’s outstanding. Even though it still has a bit of acidic kick, it has a soft mouthfeel with subtle nuances of tartness and a deep and refined apple essence from mature old trees. It reminded me of a good Trabanco. I was in the right place, at the right time and I scored a brand new cider before it even hit the market. <br> Similarly, I stopped into Haykin Family Cider the other day in A-town, Colorado where I had a brief conversation with Dan Haykin, half of the dynamic duo over there, and told him that the 2018 vintage of Scarlet Surprise was probably the best cider I’ve ever tasted (indeed, it’s the highest scoring cider I’ve reviewed to date) and he said they just sent out the 2019 vintage to their club members and he thought he had one left lying around. After looking around he came up with literally the last one, and I got it! He warned me that it was quite different from the previous year, and it was, but it was still excellent. It is a bright cider with an acidic tartness that darts across your tongue. That tartness lingers into a really long and lovely finish that is more mellow, creamy, tannic and soft. A deeply satisfying cider <br> The point being that good things happen to those in contact with their local cider makers! I know we all can’t go in, and maybe we shouldn’t be having a good cider drink with friends at the moment, but call your local cider maker to see what they have around, get bottles to go, use local delivery schemes, buy gift certificates and support local cider businesses so we can all enjoy them again when this is all over. Don’t let this global pandemic take any more of our neighbors’ businesses. Some of us are struggling financially as well, and maybe can’t help, but if you are able let’s share some love.

        "Body": "On Christmas Day, 1674, the Swedish Empire, then at its height in Europe, marched 15,000 troops into Uckermark beginning their invasion of Brandenburg-Prussia controlled by the powerful Hohenzollern family. The Swedish-Brandenburg War would embroil much of northern Europe for the next five years. For many in the <span class=\"feebackItalic\">apfelwein</span> industry, the explosion of über-sweet Swedish ciders onto the European market in the first decade of the twenty-first century may have felt like another invasion, especially to those traditional German cider makers who can boast a much longer heritage. However, I have found a Swedish cider maker, Fruktstereo, based out of Malmö that makes a farmhouse cider completely on the other end of the spectrum form the more famous Swedish brands, to set alongside a classy bottle of German Apfelwein by Stefan Vetter. <br> The German option has a much more enticing glass appeal with a rich golden hue and a medium amount of bubbles, whereas the Fruktstereo has a slightly hazy golden straw color. (I also prefer the classic bottle art of the Vetter to the cartoon homage to Oasis’ <span class=\"feebackItalic\">Definitely Maybe</span> album, in spite of the number of times I put Wonderwall on repeat in the 90s) The aroma of the Swedish cider was much more intriguing and was quite unlike any cider I have smelled before with an interesting mix of stone fruits and sweetened sourdough bread. The apfelwein had a lighter body, fairly dry with some tartness in the finish, but overall not particularly memorable. The Fruktstereo on the other hand a more bitter and somber mood and was heavier with a thicker mouthfeel. <br> Both of these were good, but I didn’t fall in love with either, especially for the price tag they carry. Nor would I suggest either to new cider drinkers and would only recommend them to seasoned cider vets looking for something unique. While I was intrigued by the funky nose of the Fruktstereo, its brooding, heavy nature with sour and bitter tones gave off a vibe of \"I could care less if I made friends,\" but if sour and bitter is your thing and you think April Ludgate could be your bestie, give this a whirl. On the other hand, the Vetter doesn’t come off as particularly unique or special. It is similar to a number of European carbonated ciders out there that are also right on the sweet/dry divide, but when compared it falls short, especially as I paid in the mid-$20s for my bottle. (See my individual review for other suggestions) So, both are good, neither is outstanding. In many ways it was like the War between Sweden and Brandenburg that followed the Christmas invasion. There were small wins for both sides but at the end of the day, five years later, Brandenburg ultimately retained its territory. In this case, the German held its ground—its more approachable and there are more moods in which one would want to drink this bottle—but it wasn’t a particularly impressive or definitive win over the newcomer.",

        "Body": "The great plains of Kansas and Nebraska are obviously more known for wheat, corn and soybeans, but the closer to the Missouri River you get, you can find some orchards and there are at least two cider producers, just a couple of hundred miles apart, making cider in America’s heartland. Though the coasts are more well known for their cider industry, tonight I try two flagship ciders from the great plains—Glacial Till’s Original and Somerset Ridge’s Lucky Dog. <br> Both of these are fairly similar in color, fairly pale, but I think the nose clearly goes to Lucky Dog as it is rich, tart, dry and a lovely cherry aroma seeps out if you sniff it long enough. The Glacial Till on the other hand has a very candied aroma which doesn’t usually do it for me. When it comes to taste, Lucky Dog is drier, more subtle and with a finish that is killer—like a soft little apple cloud that just lingers in your mouth. It is a drink you can sit down and have a conversation with. Not one for subtleties, the Glacial Till will bowl you over with a sugary taste and, comparatively, it is much bolder and thicker. It is like someone slapped you in the face and took off running as a joke. <br> Thus, from first sip it is clear these are two very different drinks. The best way I can describe it is that it is like the two different sides of Lake McConaughy, the most popular recreation area in Nebraska. Because this lake has the only beach within a reasonable driving distance for many college coeds attending school in the plains, it has quite the party scene during spring break (don’t google the pictures). Glacial Till’s Original Cider is geared for that part of the lake with its pontoon party boats equipped with slides and trampolines and where you have to dodge the jet skis whizzing around. It is loud with a bold taste that goes down easy. Drink it fast, drink it slow, it doesn’t matter—it is sweet, sugary and pretty good. Lucky Dog, however, is one of those private coves where families set up Pottery Barn picnic tables with table cloths and wicker baskets full of charcuterie for a lovely evening meal spread over a couple of hours with friends. One of these drinks is meant to be savored, so slow down and savor it. The other is sweet, easy to drink and crushable. So, what’s your mood? On this occasion the professor is not hanging out with his students and is clearly going for the Lucky Dog which enables him to enjoy and excellent dry cider. It’s exquisite.",

        "Body": "The American mid-west. Flat. Agricultural. Small towns. Small farms. Tough winters. Hearty folk. Good Cider? I wanted to find out, so I found two ciders both of which were unfiltered and seemed a good pairing. One ended up being a descent farmhouse (Cottonwood Creek’s College Try) and the other was not sure if it was cider, wine, or something else (Soldier Creek’s Ghost Pig).<br> In comparing these two, there are immediately noticeable differences with the Ghost Pig being a translucent pale straw color and super bubbly, whereas the College Try was darker, slightly cloudy, and darn near still. College Try also had the nose I preferred which was clam and rich, while Ghost Pig’s nose was heavier, more sour and had a more fermented smell. The Ghost Pig had a bit of multiple personality disorder in that it was super bubbly to begin with and lighter-bodied in the middle, but had a heavier dull tone in the finish. The first cider I’ve had blended with a completed wine, it did not seem to have the best features of either drink. It really didn’t fit neatly in either category, and though it wasn’t bad, it was unclear of what it was trying to be. The College Try seemed to have a clearer personality as a farmhouse-style cider, albeit a pretty mild mannered farmhouse. Though it had a good bit of acidity and a little twang, the barrel aging actually mellowed it out and softened it a bit to the point where the finish went out with a whimper. <br> To stick with the college analogy, College try was like that really excited first -year college student full of excitement and potential at the beginning, and became pretty gung ho when they found a subject they loved, declared a major and started taking courses in their wheelhouse, but maybe lost some steam in the end, however, they graduated with descent scores even if not head of their class. College Try really comes on fairly strong with some twangy farmhouse notes, but had an uneventful finish that lacked the depth and character of great natural ciders. Ghost Pig on the other hand was that undecided student that never really figured out what they wanted to be. It may have had shinning moments in particular classes, but never became deeply saturated in one discipline. This cider had decent characteristics from three drink genres, but didn’t engender any of them fully. So, I guess I’d rather have College Try because even though it is not the most memorable student, (I mean farmhouse cider) I’ve had, it grasped the essence of being a farmhouse-style cider, and it got the job done.",

        "ID": 105,
        "Body": "Many Americans have a favorite apple. For most of us it is one of the cosmetically perfect dessert apples we find in the grocery store. (In my family there are frequent disagreements over whether Honeycrisp or Pink Ladies are best, and deserving of a spot in the grocery cart) But anyone in the cider industry will tell you that these sweet apples don’t always produce the best ciders because they lack the depth of other varieties that can bring more than sweetness. However, these are the apples Americans know and love and U.S. cidermakers continue to try their hand at making ciders out of them. But usually, they have to be blended with other varietals. I’d say this only works about half the time in my experience. While tonight’s comparative review might not finally settle the dispute in my household over the best apples to eat, hopefully it will give my readers some direction in choosing from cider made with one of these two fan favorites. Neither of these may be a true single varietal as the Yankee Cider Co.’s Honeycrisp is clearly a blend (with \"Delicious\" and McIntosh apples) and Ten Towers’ Voodoo Lady is ambiguous if it is made with 100% Pink Lady apples. <br> Side by side, I think the best nose clearly has to go to Voodoo Lady which is light and refreshing, fruity and a little tropical. Honeycrisp is very deep but a bit vinegary, and will be pretty potent for most drinkers. The Voodoo Lady, however, is probably a little over bubbly, and the carbonation probably adds to the fact that it is crisper than the Honeycrisp. It also has no burn, whereas the Honeycrisp has more burn from start to finish, not too much though and it is not at scrumpy levels. Honeycrisp has an ideal medium body and a sweet and almost jammy middle phase. The Voodoo Lady, on the other hand, only has a small amount of acid and just a bit of a bite to it, but the body is a tad thin in the middle. So, phase two goes to Honeycrisp. While Honeycrisp has the stronger finish of the two, I actually preferred the finish on the Voodoo Lady which has some nice subtleties if one is willing to slow down and appreciate them. <br> I love the locales of both of these ciders and I love the apples they are made from. Yankee Cider Co. is based in East Haddam, Connecticut, the location of Nathan Hale’s first teaching gig (The Yale-educated first martyr of the American Revolution) and just north of charming Old Saybrook. Ten Towers is based in Rickreall, Oregon, in the fertile valley between Portland and Eugene. I will say from the outset that neither cider clearly reminds me of a Honeycrisp or a Pink Lady apple. But the one that keeps it light, crisp and refreshing the most is the Voodoo Pink Lady. Even though in our family dispute over the best eating apple, I actually side with the Honeycrisp faction, I have to vote against the Yankee Cider Co. Honeycrisp Blend because the balance is not quite right as there is too much burn and acetic acid smell to represent the rich and crisp sweet taste of the Honeycrisp apple. Certainly, if you like bit of burn or had a heavy, fatty meal to cut this cider, it could be great. It definitely has you licking your lips. But Voodoo Lady, despite its slightly thin body, better reminds Americans of the crisp sweet apples they know and love. It is light and would go with a number of meals. While this is not a declaration that Pink Ladies are better apples, I probably would grab the 10 Towers Voodoo Lady over the Yankee Honeycrisp Blend.",

        "Body": "The official start of winter was earlier this week, and this is the time when loads of silver-haired yankees do the Jet Blue shuffle down to Florida to work on their leathery tans all winter long. In honor of those snowbirds, I thought I’d try two ciders, one from their starting point and one from their destination, to see what their cider options look like. The first is the flagship cider from Rootstock Ciderworks, just above the finger lakes in upstate New York, and Pedaler’s Hard Cider from theme-park-filled Orlando, Florida. <br> When comparing these two side by side the Roostock’s cider is a pale straw color and the Pedaler’s is pale gold and a tad bubblier. The Floridian option has a deeper, richer, nose that I preferred, but Rootstock was crisper with a tangy nose of tart green apple skins. It’s flavor is tarter as well and it also had an unusually woody and botanical smell and taste that reminded me of a young broken twig. The Pedaler’s was a very well balanced semi-sweet cider with the right amount crisp, tart and sweet. It also had a heavier body than the Rootstock. <br> So, I am left with the question, ‘were the snowbirds better off staying put or flying south for the winter?’ (At least when it comes to cider options) Both are very good options—both in real life and in these drinks—if you live in upstate New York or across the Champlain in New England you are pretty lucky. And life in the sunshine state probably ain’t that bad either. Similarly, these are both pretty good ciders, both go down smoothly and would be easy to drink whether watching football or sitting by the pool. While the Rootstock is the more interesting and unique of the two with its sapling-like qualities, I’d probably take the more well-rounded Pedaler’s again. Maybe this corresponds to their locations as the northeast is probably more quirky and known for its individualism than Florida. (And yes, I know the northeast has a much longer cider heritage and many more options) But I think I will take the well manicured, blemish-free Pedaler’s as it has everything you could want in a refreshing, slightly sweet cider. Its incredibly balanced and well done. So, this round goes to Florida.",

        "Body": "I love the upper south, the people, the culture, the green rolling hills, and the long tradition of apple growing and cider making. It is home to both a number of heirloom varietals and a handful of American forefathers who shared my love of cider and even grew their own apples for pressing into cider. I must admit my roots and my own forefathers came from this area and I still have close friends and family in the region and it holds a special place in my heart. So today I review the flagship semi-sweet (and in one case very sweet) ciders from three modern cider houses of the region: Blue Bee Cider of Richmond, Virginia’s Aragon 1904, Golden Apple of the Tennessee Cider Company of Pigeon Forge at the base of the Smokey Mountains, (not far from my ancestral home and beautiful country), and finally Wise Bird of Kentucky’s Pomme Pomme. Though the Bluegrass state will always be associated with bourbon more than cider, there are at least a couple of cider makers in the Lexington area producing solid and innovative ciders. Time to try these semi-sweet flagships. <br> The difference in effervescence is immediately noticeable upon pouring with Golden Apple fairly still, Blue Bee in the middle with the Wise Bird being the bubbliest. The Tennessee and Kentucky drinks are both pale straw with a deeper pale gold from the Virginian. The winner when it comes to aroma was no competition as Wise Bird had a nose that smelled of absorbent gel and wasn’t particularly pleasant; Golden Apple smelled candied and artificially sweet; and finally, Blue Bee had this luscious deep aroma of berries, cherries and honey. Lovely. When it comes to flavor and other tasting characteristics, the Golden Apple was clearly the sweetest and smoothest of the three. It will be too sweet for most drinkers, but they deliver on their promise of grownup apple juice. The Pomme Pomme had a great mouthfeel with a nice body, but I could never fall in love with the flavor which had a unique earthiness to it. Lastly, the Blue Bee was a complex and sophisticated cider right near the middle of the sweetness scale. It seemed to pull so many levers at once when it came to the various aspects you look for in a cider. <br> Choosing for me tonight is not particularly difficult, but for you it may depend on your preferences and mood. While the Golden Apple is too sweet for my taste, it is well made and well balanced and could be drunk all night if you had a bit of a sweet tooth. The Pomme Pomme is also a well-made cider with a quirky, non-traditional, taste profile that is kind of sweet, but kind of earthy and with a nose that was making my eyebrow raise more than it should. The last, Blue Bee’s Aragon 1904 is excellent. My sister has bragged how this is her favorite cider maker in Virginia, and after trying it for the first time I can see why. This is not your <span class=\"feebackItalic\">standard</span> \"semi-sweet.\" This is a semi-sweet for the cider makers and cider lovers who cherish the apple and the long and rich tradition of cider making in Virginia. The apples are sweet and pleasant, but also bring so much more to the drink. Blue Bee’s Aragon 1904 has sweetness but it does not if you over the head with it. Similarly, its rich honey notes are not overly bold. It is confident, understated and sophisticated and you definitely feel as if you’ve had a proper drink. A semi-sweet for the modern, grown up cider drinker.",

        "ID": 108,
        "Body": "If you are new to cider and coming from the world of wine, you might have heard of the <span class=\"feebackItalic\">pétillant naturel</span>, or pét-nat method of making sparkling wines. Sometimes referred to as the <span class=\"feebackItalic\">methode ancestral</span>, this is a centuries-old tradition which is both more simple, and more daring, than other forms of making sparkling wines and ciders. In essence, the cider is bottled before it is done with its initial fermentation process, allowing the yeasts to eat the sugars creating both alcohol and carbon dioxide, and thus creating a naturally petillant or bubbly drink. Most other drinks complete the fermentation process before bottling (some will pump in carbon dioxide at this point), or, as with the more complicated <span class=\"feebackItalic\">méthode champenoise</span>, or traditional method, the finished wine will undergo a second fermentation in a bottle, when sugar or another sweetener will be added to achieve its bubbles (which sometimes includes time on a rack upside down and a process of disgorgement). Because the pét-nat cidermaker bottles before fermentation, it is largely a guess to know what the yeasts and sugars will do before the top is popped and ready for the drinker to have a flavorful surprise. While not super common, I was able to get my hands on two ciders using this process: one from Maine using a single apple varietal, Stark, from Rocky Ground; and Farmstead’s Teton Pét-Nat naming their drink with a little local French lingo to complement the French style. (well played) <br> In comparing the two, I do think the Stark is a wink prettier in the glass with its beautiful golden color. The nose on the Stark is strongly acidic, but with a pleasant fruity undertone, whereas the Teton Pét-Nat’s more sprightly bubbles also make for a crisper nose that is lightly sweet and a bit acidic. It is certainly the more petillant of the two. The flavor mostly follows on from the nose for both drinks, with Stark proving to be more strongly acidic, more intriguing, and bit bitter in the finish. It is like a mellow farmhouse that is not too potent. The Wyoming cider is lighter, crisper, with a tarter character than the Stark. It is also more refreshing, and even though it is very bubbly, it is still quite dry. <br> I don’t want to pretend that I’m a pét-nat expert—I’m not—but it seems Farmstead has better captured the desired goal of a pét-nat: a naturally petillant and sparkling drink. Compared to the Stark, Teton is much lighter and bubblier. It’s crisp, fresh and maybe a bit tart (making it a more pronounced <span class=\"feebackItalic\">cider</span>  pét-nat essence compared to wine pét-nats) and from that point alone, I feel the need to give the nod to Farmstead. However, mood should determine everything. Do you want a still cider that is not excitable, but calm, subtle and lovely? Do you like the farmhouse style and more mellowness without a ton of character or an acidic burn? Do you want to sit on a rocking chair watching the world go by without a sweet attention-grab drink, and maybe a skosh bitter? Rocky Ground’s Stark is down-to-earth will do just fine. If, however, you want something with a little more pep in its step, a cider with a crisp, bubbly, acidic bite that’s not over the top; as well as something that is a bit tart which would pair with a rich juicy meal by cutting the flavor with its crispness, then the Teton Pét-Nat would be great! Certainly, I wish I had another.",

        "ID": 109,
        "Body": "One of my favorite comparative reviews so far was the original Cherry Royale featuring a German cider, two from the Pacific Northwest, and one from Colorado which was the last cider standing—Colorado Cider Company’s Cherry Glider. In the last couple of years I have collected a couple more cherry ciders from some of CCC’s Colorado neighbors and decided to put them up against the reigning champ. The contenders are Colorado+49s Black Cherry, C Squared’s Dark Tart Cherry and Western Colorado’s Snow Capped Sour Cherry which has picked up a couple of awards at competitions. So, let’s breakdown the cherry options from the Centennial State. <br> The Black Cherry and Sour Cherry look almost identical with an opaque salmon color; the Glider is a translucent copper and the Dark Tart Cherry is the prettiest and lives up to its name with a dark and still red wine-looking appearance. I think the Dark Tart Cherry also has the most interesting and inviting nose of bitter cocoa powder; the Sour Cherry actually has a sour cherry nose and the Glider has a deep rich cherry aroma with some apple peeking through. The Black Cherry is the most curious, as it smells of cucumber and that aroma carries through to the flavor of the drink. In this sense, it doesn’t feel like it delivered on what was promised. While I was hoping for something dark and rich, I got a light, garden-like, cider. The Glider was the brightest cider that was refreshing and well balanced and it tasted like a cherry flavored cider and not a cherry drink. So the cherries just enhanced the tartness of a nice crisp apple cider. When it comes to tart though, the Sour Cherry takes the cake as it was the tartest and clearly in the sour range. It was, however, crisper on the tongue than the Dark Tart Cherry which has the most interesting flavor of the four. It was dark, super still, and mysterious. The weight was a bit heavy and the mouthfeel more dull than the others. <br> Let’s start with the two salmon-colored ciders. Colorado+49 can’t be the winner. Though it is not a bad cider, the light garden-like cherry with cucumber as the main flavor just can’t win a cherry competition. Especially as black cherry was promised and a rich, dark, tart cherry flavor was expected. Snow Capped is a contender. It is well balanced, fairly smooth and with the tiniest amount of farmhouse funk that many cider fans like myself enjoy, but it is pretty sour and without a clear cherry flavor. I don’t think it’s the winner either, but if you like a really tart drink or sour beers, give this a try, I think you’ll like it. That brings us to the Dark Tart Cherry and the champ. Dark looks more inviting and mysterious and that nose had me pledging allegiance and wanting to explore its richness further. The bitter chocolate cocoa vibe could be what I am after. Maybe this would work on Valentine’s Day. If I had cranked up the bass on a Barry White album and was sitting on a plush velvet Ottoman, this would win. And if I were a red wine drinker exploring cider for the first time, this is where I’d go. But at the end of the day the champion still stands. It is the best all-around drink that has just the right amount of crispness, tartness, sweetness, and cherryness to make everyone happy. It’s good. A refreshing apple cider with just enough cherry flavor to elevate the apple flavor without being gimmicky. If cherry is your thing, just try some.",

The first is Schilling’s Rosé Vacay. Schilling consistently makes great cider and is a crowd favorite, and there isn’t a bad drink in their lineup. The second is Snow Capped Cider’s Molly’s Rockies Rosé which apparently was a cider made especially for a local chain of large warehouse-style liquor stores in Colorado and also recently won a double-gold from the Cidercraft Awards according to the can. Thus, two worthy contenders; so how do they stack up? <br> It should be said first that some of these ciders have great glass appeal as I love both the reddish tawny amber color of Molly’s as well as the caramel copper color of Possman. Schilling’s Rosé Vacay had the strongest and most potent nose with clear bittersweet apples and floral notes, the Possman nose was the fruitiest whereas Molly’s was probably the deepest and most complex of the three and the one that I enjoyed most. The Possman is semi-sweet but has an earthy black currant flavor that is a bit like a summer garden in your mouth. It is super smooth and a bit viscous and is so still that it is almost like juice. This was the easiest to drink of the three. Like Possman, Molly’s really coats the palette and has a nice mouthfeel. It had the most layers and its well balanced, but heavy, mixing of apple and wine flavors works really well. It has a bit more of an alcohol taste than the Possman. The Schilling is fizzier and dryer than the others as well as being crisper, lighter and the most acidic. <br> Choosing a winner on this one is tough as all of these are good rosé ciders. The Schilling is fun, casual and refreshing and if you want a dry, light rosé cider to replace your wine spritzer or sangria at an outdoor party, this is really good and would do the trick. But if you want something more serious, the Possman and Molly’s are better options. Both have a great mouthfeel. The Possman is super viscous and still—maybe too much like a thick juice for some—and the Molly’s also has a heavier still presence that lightly coats the tongue. At the end of the day, even though I love the outstanding Possman and its easy drinkability, the complex intrigue of Molly’s with its multiple layers and rich and somber character I found more compelling and intriguing—good for a reflective evening or a night of good conversation. Those that like fine wine and cider should go with the cider that uses Pinova, a German cultivar (Molly’s), and not the cider made in Germany.",

        "Body": "I love the colonial-era history of the East Coast and these two drinks come from just upriver of two of the oldest European settlements in North American history—Yankee Cider Co. is located just north of Old Saybrook (1635) and Blue Bee in Richmond is just upriver from Jamestown (1607). The land is rich, green and beautiful and the people and architecture are both lovely and quintessentially American. Blue Bee has teamed up with Wise Bird of Kentucky and have produced a drink that pays attention to the pre-revolutionary drinking heritage of both these places by combining the Hewe’s or Virginia Crab which was first cultivated in the early 1700s (and was found at Thomas Jefferson’s Monticello) and the long tradition of Bourbon Whiskey which also began in the 1700s in Kentucky—by a Baptist Minister no less! Since it is “dry January” I thought I should try two dry ciders from these two regions who once helped create the cider industry in North America which at one time was the quintessentially American beverage industry. Thus, New England Dry v. the Bird and Bee which is labelled as dry as it gets. <br> From the glass there are obvious differences as Yankee is a pale straw color where Bird and Bee has a brilliant medium amber color. The noses are starkly different with the Bird and Bee smelling like whiskey which masks any apple aroma, and the fruitier nose of the Yankee which is lighter but rich, and which I definitely preferred. While the Blue Bee may suffer from too much flavor, the New England Dry suffers from not having enough. The Blue Bee has a very bold, slightly harsh, whiskey flavor, whereas the New England dry has weak characteristics and a bit of a watery mouthfeel. Thought slightly tart, it lacked any pop which seemed so promising in its beautiful nose. In some ways the apple loses out in both these drinks as it is not a prominent presence in either. <br> Choosing a winner is easy and difficult at the same time. One is uniquely American, showcasing the best of American ingenuity when it comes to how we have distinctly placed our marks on two old world drink traditions—cider and whiskey. However, I also recognize that many of my readers may not care for a whiskey-flavored cider and just want something easy to drink and maybe a bit tart. If that is you, the New England Dry is your drink. It is pretty good, if unimaginative. The Blue Bee/Wise Bird collaboration on the other hand is a carefully and well-made drink. Though I am not a huge whiskey fan, I appreciate the craft that went into this drink and can immediately tell the high quality of this well-balanced, yet bold, offering. I could not drink this every night and be true to myself, but this is one of the best tasking whiskey-like ciders I’ve ever tried and for those of you who enjoy both drink genres, and want a stiff drink for a night of gentlemanly conversation, or maybe just to read by lamplight in your favorite winged-back chair, this collaboration is a hybrid of two American classics and a worthy drink of your time.",

        "Body": "“Western imperialism” is a term that conjures up many negative feelings in the world of history and international politics, but in the cider world imperial ciders from the American west constitute a tradition to be proud of. Like their brewed cousins, imperial-style ciders originated in Britain and can be found throughout New England, however, this bold and hardy tradition made it to the Pacific Northwest several years ago and several cideries there produce these heavy ciders with higher ABV. Tonight, I review Excelsior, the imperial cider from Schilling, which may be the largest, most popular cidery in the Pacific Northwest, with C Squared’s recently released Radical Liberator, which to my knowledge is the first imperial-style cider produced by a Colorado cidery. I will say from the outset I hope this tradition continues to grow across the US and beyond as I love these ciders and tonight is no exception because both of these ciders make me as a happy as a history professor in an old-world library. <br> Both of these drinks have a beautiful golden hue. In the glass the Excelsior is clearly bubblier as the Liberator is more or less flat. The Excelsior has a sweeter and brighter nose with a mix of sugar, acidity and the apple juice you had in your childhood with just a bit of spice. The Liberator has a deeper, more intriguing nose. The barrel aging makes it smell more like a proper drink, which I preferred. The Excelsior is sweeter and a bit lighter and it even has a bit of bounce to it because of the bubbles. It has some tart notes and a really rounded flavor with tart acidity. The Liberator clearly has a heavier mouthfeel, but it is not overbearing. It has an incredible finish that creates a bit of alcoholic heat in the back of the throat, but also produces a type of creamy caramel reprise. <br> Man, please don’t make me choose between these two drinks, they are both excellent! I’d be excited  to open my cider fridge and find either of these and proud to share them with any of my serious cider drinking friends. Neither is for hard seltzer drinkers. (I mean it’s just chemicals in water? <span class=\"feebackItalic\">shakes head in disdain</span>) But here is how I’d separate the two: recently I’ve been reading about the Dhufar Rebellion in the Sultanate of Oman in the 1960s and 70s. At the beginning there were two groups committed to overthrowing the Sultan and his Western imperialist overlords—the tribal groups and the committed communist idealogues. A couple of years in, some of the tribal groups were willing to compromise when a new sultan came to power with whom they found some common ground; whereas the true revolutionaries vowed for no compromises and to never give in to a system supported by western imperialists. Well, Schilling is the tribalists. Are they willing to carry the banner of the imperial cider revolution? Yes. This is a serious cider with depth and complexity and enough heft to feel like this is a proper drink worthy of your time and attention. And yet, at the end of the day it is light-hearted, semi-sweet with an astronaut giraffe on the can. (I know I’ve been accused of reading too much into can art, but it often gives us insights into the characteristics cider makers see in their ciders) So they are willing to fight the cause of imperial ciders, but they still want to make sure sweet cider drinkers will drink it and thus make it more approachable. The Radical Liberator is committed to the cause of serious cider until the bitter and complex end. Every element of this cider is elevated and bold and yet still smooth and well-balanced. Yes, the tannic structure of the Excelsior is complex, but the Radical liberator has complex tannins with the barrel-aged dimension and the powerful finish, and it captures every element of the imperial genre. There will be nights when I prefer the “lighter” and sweeter Excelsior, but when I want a serious drink that’s sold out to the cause of bold and intricate imperial ciders, I’ll turn to the Radical Liberator.",

        "Body": "It is supposed to get down negative one degree tonight and as the snow begins to gentle alight on my porch, I have decided I wanted something tropical so I found these two guava ciders in my cider cellar, and I thought I would give them a try. I cranked up “Legend” by Bob Marley and Wailers and cracked open California Cider Company’s ACE Guava and St. Vrain Cidery’s Pink Guava. Here is how they compare: <br> St. Vrain looks like any old bubbly straw colored cider where ACE has a peachy salmon color that is really appealing. It looks unfiltered and is very lightly carbonated. ACE also smells more like fresh squeezed guava juice, whereas St. Vrain smells of tart apple, sugar and has a nice guava undertone. As a side note, the can art award goes to St. Vrain which has a color scheme of something I am pretty sure I would wear, whereas as the ACE can is a bit busy. When it come to flavor St. Vrain only has a little guava taste and not a ton of apple flavor either. ACE also has little apple taste, but way more fresh guava juice which leaves little bits on the side of the glass. ACE has a smoother mouthfeel though remains crisp throughout in spite of those big and soft guava notes. The St. Vrain has a thinner body and is sharper but without much flavor backing those sharp notes. It is an empty sharpness, if that makes sense to you. <br> While St. Vrain’s Pink Guava was a good cider, it failed to transport me this cold evening the same way ACE did. As soon as I tasted ACE, I was immediately brought back to a number of visits to South America I had in my youth where every morning I drank all the fresh guava juice that my hosts had on hand. While it is not quite the same as having a thick and juicy drink made from fresh-squeezed perfectly ripe guavas, this is the best canned guava beverage I’ve had. I think it goes without saying that the alcohol and sharpness enhanced by the apples does make it unique to straight juice. This drinks as easy as juice, if not smoother. It is so crushable I think you could down a pitcher of this stuff on a hot day without blinking twice. But be careful, it’s still hard cider after all. This is the second unfiltered (or lightly filtered?) fruit cider from ACE that’s been excellent. Thank you sir, may I have another?",

        "Body": "Both of these cideries tonight take pride in the use of Harrison cider apples. This varietal is not only unique to America, but in the late 1700s and early 1800s it was one of America’s most popular cider apples. Hailing from the heavily wooded mid-Atlantic, this speckled yellow apple has a number of characteristics that make it ideal for cider. It’s got a formidable sugar content, so even after fermenting the ABV is considerable (both of these are at 8% or higher). But it produces dry and slightly tannic drinks and so when it has “rediscovered” in the late 1970s with what might have been the last Harrison tree in the US, it has become a staple of the cider revival of recent years. In that vein of rediscovering the richness of our cider tradition here in the US, I decided to drink Harrisons from two cidermakers just south of its homeland—Albemarle from Virginia and Wise Bird from Kentucky—who are trying their hand at this classic American varietal. (In many ways it is now a mainstay of those cider markers who are serious about single varietal work) <br> Both ciders are a gold straw color with bubbles, though Wise Bird may be a hint cloudier. I love the Albemarle nose which is crisp, bright and fruity. The Wise Bird has a more neutral nose and it is almost like the flavor is masked. But you will get some nice cherry notes if you breath in deep enough. The Albemarle is lighter and crisper where the Wise Bird is sturdier. When it comes to flavor Albemarle has a very mild sourness in the second phase, a nicely tannic finish that is also slightly phenolic. It is an interesting cider and more refreshing than Wise Bird. The Kentucky Harrison though is more sure of itself. It is smoother and has a nice mix of bitterness and fruit. <br> I’m glad I did this review. A bottle of Harrison has been one of my most memorable reviews and I was eager to try some more. Neither of these disappointed, even if they didn’t live up to the memory of the first. The Albemarle is a solid cider and hits some of the highlights of what is becoming one of America’s retro classics. It has a beautiful nose, is drying and has a finish that is subtle but intriguing. For me, though, I preferred the Wise Bird which just created a classic cider that is deep and rich. I don’t know much about the original “Harrison” but if he is a self-assured southern gentleman that takes things in stride without getting overexcited, this was his drink! Complex and mellow. I’d sit down and smoke a cigar with Wise Bird’s gentlemanly drink any day.",

While this spring break won’t look the same due to the pandemic, there is still less fear and uncertainty than this time last year. But maybe some will find rest and a true break, even if only for a bit. I have two ciders for upperclassmen and thirsty professors that might create a little lighthearted sunshine and tropical experience whether they are actually experiencing the sun or just stuck on campus dreaming they were. Both are based on tropical classics. The newly released Paloma by Stem Ciders is based on the Mexican beach cocktail of the same name, and Hale & True’s ode to the Hawaiian original POG (Passionfruit, Orange and Guava). So let’s break them down: <br> The POGA is a bit bubbly while the Paloma is almost still with its more interesting cloudy melon coloring. The nose though goes to POGA which is brighter and more tropical, though Paloma is probably deeper and fruitier. The POGA is dryer, mellower, more subdued and probably more self-assured. It is not a big bold tropical-flavored cider, but the dry essence of the drink really allows the passionfruit and orange to come out in the finish, which is killer. The Paloma is brighter, with a much higher amount of citric acid that really begins to build in the middle grapefruit phase that crescendos into a burst of lime flavor in the finish, which is almost too much. <br> Both of these are really good, and each is unique in their own right—I have never had these exact flavor combos in any other ciders. Choosing is difficult. The Paloma with its one-of-a-kind lime punch should be experienced, but I don’t feel I could have more than one of these, whereas it would be easy to knock out several POGAs in one sitting. So, when choosing I think I’d rather go with Hale and True, because in my imaginary, non-existent, spring break, I think I’d rather be “stuck” with this drink. It does not have the big bold passionfruit flavor of a Passport (one of my favorite ciders, earning top marks), but it provides the passion and guava flavors I love in a more subtle, dry and sophisticated way. The Paloma wants to be seen in designer swimwear at a fancy resort pool, whereas the POGA is better suited to a hammock between two palm trees where it is clam, quiet and deeply relaxing. In this fantasy, I could see myself swaying in the breeze with a good book, no kids, no students, and a handful of these for an afternoon to myself. Now that is spring break in the sunshine to me! Want a dry, sophisticated and chill tropical cider to make your spring break fantasy come true? Try a POGA, they ship to almost anywhere in America where you might be stuck. In fact, I think I might pour another. Happy grading to me.",

But you also don’t want to the feelings of guilt the moment you crack open the can? Well, these are meant to scratch your cider itch and help you feel less guilty doing it. It seems a uniquely American thing to take a good thing and make it not quite as good just to help us feel better about ourselves so we can take part in guilty pleasures and feel less, well, guilty. It is no surprise that the US cider industry has started producing “light” ciders. The trick to making these two ciders light is honestly just watering them down so you get less juice which means less sugar and calories. Thus, technically they are not 100% ciders, unless water-flavored ciders count? These two—Austin Eastciders’ Brut Super Dry Cider and Original Sin’s Cidre Libre—are actually not that bad. <br> In comparing the two side-by-side, the first thing that has to be said is that the Original Sin tall and skinny black cans are on point! The Brut is a brilliant gold straw color where Cidre Libre looks more like cloudy lemonade. The Brut has a pretty musty fermented smell whereas the Cidre Lirbre has a fresh tangy and acidic nose that I preferred. The Brut has a more intense yeasty flavor and is dry and sugary. The Cidre Libre has a more natural apple flavor that is tarter and more like a farmhouse cider. The Brut’s body is thinnish with a watery mouthfeel whereas the Cidre Libre is smoother with a heavier body—but is still a lightweight. <br> So obviously neither of these are going to make a cider purest happy, and neither animates me, but for what they are, they are pretty good. If I were out with friends and one of these was the one cider option, or I was trying to watch my diet, I’d definitely take one again. My choice tonight, though, is the Cidre Libre which of the four or so light ciders I’ve reviewed, is probably the best to date. The unfiltered style and apple choice just give it more of a country apple cider feel with some raw apple notes that feel hearty but refreshing. If you’re not a farmhouse fan, and like a more straight forward American style standard semi-dry cider, then go for the Brut. It is smooth and interesting, if uninspiring. If you’ve been scared off of farmhouse ciders due to the funk and burn, Cidre Libre may be a good opportunity to experience a tiny tinge of twang in the lightest format possible. In general, though, the Cider Professor recommends you save up your calories so you can experience the full show and not just a watered down version of good cider.",

        "Body": "I’m sitting out on a sunny Sunday afternoon in the crisp mountain air and trying a couple of drinks from two of the most serious American cidermakers. Pretty lucky. Both of these cider makers have a deep respect of cider tradition and heritage, so much so that they have been willing to ship European apples to the US to attempt to make a proper old-world drink while putting their own unique Yankee touches on it. As someone who appreciates both European and American traditions, I am incredibly pleased with the results. First is Shacksbury’s Arlo which mixes Basque apples with New England’s finest to create a traditional sidra as found in northern Spain. ANXO’s Hereford Gold is another collaboration between the DC-based ciderhouse and revered English cider maker, Tom Oliver; again, importing Herefordshire bittersweets and blending them with Gold Rush apples from Pennsylvania. The marriage of Old World and New is a romance flick I could actually stay awake for. <br> The two look quite different in the glass as Arlo has that bubbly Country Time lemonade look where Hereford Gold has a gorgeous golden straw color that is more attractive. The nose of the ANXO is bold and acidic in the center with some lightness around the edges, but definitely more intense than the deep aroma of soft crushed apples found in the Arlo—which I found more appealing. The Arlo is lighter bodied and more tart, with a small dollop of that classic Spanish funk with just a kiss of sour in the finish and some very mild burning in the back of the throat. The Hereford Gold has a much more pronounced sting, but the acidity is felt more on the top of the palate than in the throat. It is more medium-bodied and the bittersweet apples makes this more complex with some nice tannic minerality. Both are dry, but both provide a ton of flavor and stay fairly true to the styles of Northern Spain and the English West Country. <br> Deciding may be straightforward if one has a known preference between a sidra and an English farmhouse. If that is the case, the choice is easy. Having tried both of these styles over the years, I would say both are true to the original. But both are quite refined in that neither is too pungent and sour or aggressive and overly acidic which is sometimes found in these European styles. Both of these will please the sophisticated and cosmopolitan American consumer, and both at a price at which one can stock up! For me, I hate choosing. The Hereford Gold takes me back to a thatched-rooved pub with a wobbly Welshman prattling on about something as I try to eat my hearty bangers and mash. It has a bite, but is still able to be refreshing at the same time. However, I think I prefer the Arlo because it is such an enjoyable mellow drink. It has enough sour spark at the end to remind me I’m not drinking some new sweet American creation, but I’m taking part (in my own small way) in an age-old tradition that has finesse, vigor and style. I’m also strangely in the mood for pintxos. Topa!",

(And increasingly a state known for its refreshingly crisp ciders) For those who live in Colorado, though, they know that the Continental Divide is more than just the line of demarcation for the country’s watershed, but in some regards it is also a line separating the two mountainous regions of the state. The Front Range, home of Rocky Mountain National Park and Pikes Peak, has seen an increasing flow of tourists and thrill seekers from the major cities where the plains meet the Rockies. The Western Slope, however, is a different kind of Colorado, further from the capital and day trippers. It is more rural, more communal, and no less majestic. While the Western Slope of Colorado has been producing good wine for some time, a couple of cideries have popped up that are starting to garner more attention. The orchard of Snow Capped Cider has been growing apples for almost a century and has more recently been producing medals at cider competitions. Fenceline, based in Mancos, is a relative newcomer. Today, somewhere west of the Continental Divide, I try the two flagship semi-dry ciders from these Western Slope Cider Makers and, boy, they did not disappoint. <br> I preferred the rich nose of the 6130 to the slightly more understated aroma of Fenceline. The Fenceline is dryer, heartier, and has a heavier mouthfeel. The yeast used also makes it a bit more intense than the 6130, which is fruitier with some pleasing stone-fruit characteristics and round mouthfeel with just a small punch of sweetness. <br> Man, these are both great, high quality, ciders that I’d be glad to have any night of the week. They both have hit the semi-dry category on the nose by producing a drink that has some of the nuance and complexity of a dry cider made of proper cider apples, but are still smooth with great mouthfeels and total drinkability. For me, then, it could go either way and it depends on the mood. Fenceline is slightly more serious, deep and with an edge from the great alcoholic aftertaste. It is a bit heavier and would be great by itself or maybe serve as a companion for watching a game, or sitting around a fire with friends on a cold evening. It is more serious and in some ways I like it more. On the other hand, the Snow Capped cider is a bit more of an outside drink for when the sun is shining. The slightly fruitier and sweeter demeanor makes it ideal for grilled chicken on the back deck or taking in a mountain lake with friends. Since it is springtime in the Rockies, I guess I’ll go for the livelier Snow Capped, but ask me again while it is still in the dead of winter and I think I’d prefer the Fenceline. Either way, if you like a semi-dry cider with a little character and a lot of drinkability, you can’t go wrong with either Western Slope gem.",

        "Body": "Northern Spain arguably has the longest running cider tradition in the world and at the heart of this tradition is the Basque country, home to a drinking culture where cider is woven into the social fabric. The best cider tradition of Basque country happens during <span class=\"feebackItalic\">txotx</span> season which runs from Saint Sebastian’s Day in late January through the end of April. Following the fall apple harvest, the cider ferments over the early winter in <span class=\"feebackItalic\">kupelas</span> (massive horizontal barrels, some reaching 20 feet in height!), but when it is ready in the early spring cider pilgrims migrate to the <span class=\"feebackItalic\">sagardotegi</span>, or ciderhouses for a meal and a ritual opening of the cider barrels. No matter where you go in Basque country the meal is the same: salt cod omelets and pink steaks followed by quince jelly and local cheese. Depending on how /“modern/” the ciderhouse is, you may be standing around tables without chairs in the front of the house, but when /“Txtotx!/” is called it is time to head to the back of the ciderhouse where you can drink as much cider as you want and mill around with other thirsty Basques. However, you have to be able to /“catch/” the cider in your glass as it is shot out several feet from a small spout about head height. This allows for a natural aeration to happen. You only take one fresh gulp at a time, but you can get in line again and again as much as you like. While the pandemic has probably limited this year’s txotx season to locals only, and I sadly won’t be making it to Basque country this go around, I thought I would try four Basque-style sidras to celebrate in my own way. <br> My collection of Basque ciders includes two natural ciders (<span class=\"feebackItalic\">Sagardo Naturala</span>) from <span class=\"feebackItalic\">Gipuzoka</span> (Basque country), including Isastegi from Tolosa and Bereziartua from Astigarraga, the small town at the center of the Basque cider world with a gobsmacking ciderhouse-to-resident ratio of 1 to 300—I like those odds! The other two are described as Basque-style: Son of Man’s Sagardo from Oregon and Gotsa’s Second Fruit Natural Sparkling Cider from the foothills outside of Tiblisi, the capital of Georgia in western Asia. So, I made some pintxos, put on /“Spain/” from the recently departed Chick Correa (followed by Davis’ /“Sketches of Spain/”) and tried to get in the mood for Spanish sidra. You should also know that all of these sidras were /“thrown/” from at least three feet for full effect, making my kitchen floor quite sticky and in need of a good mopping, but first, I drink. <br> Breaking them down, both the Son of Man and Gotsa are an opaque yellow where Isastegi is more translucent, and Bereziartua has a lovely golden straw color that is slightly hazy but the prettiest to look at in the glass. When it comes to aroma the two Spanish sidras have the strongest noses with Bereziartua being a bit phenolic, Isastegi being fairly raw and aggressive, while Gotsa had the most unique and earthy nose. Ultimately, I found the mild and subtle nose of the Son of Man most appealing. When it comes to funkiness, which sidras can be known for, they are ranked from Isastegi on top, followed by Bereziartua, Gotsa and then Son of Man—no surprise after smelling them. The American sidra has the least amount of complexity and is relatively mild. It is a nice middle-of-the-road mouthfeel, but its body came across more as a /“Sagardo Light/” compared to the others. Also, on the softer end was the Gotsa which was the lightest and airiest of the four. It felt like a higher-pitched sidra with a nice tartness, as opposed to the deep sour notes of others. It had a certain crispness that the others lacked as well. Isastegi is aggressive and acidic, the strongest drink of the four, and it will have you scraping your tongue on the top of your mouth for sure. The Bereziartua had the thickest body and the richest, most complex, taste with the bittersweet apples clearly on display. I would say this sidra has the charisma and flare of northern Spain without over doing it. <br> In choosing a winner, I’m happy to discard the Son of Man which may be good for those trying sidra for the first time, but it lacked the above-mentioned flare of most sidras. The Isastegi is on the other end of the spectrum. It is going to be too powerful for most. It is raw, funky, and with a serious punch. That leaves the Georgian cider and the Bereziartua. The Gotsa is clearly in the sidra register, but it is lighter and brighter than the Bereziartua and other sidras. The apples make it lighter and crisper almost, and softer around the edges. And though I scored it the same as Bereziartua, I guess I give the nod to Bereziartua for authenticity’s sake. It has more of the tart and sour punch one expects from a sidra. It is rich, complex, and acidic, but not too rough and still a delight—especially when paired with bold, salty or spicey foods. However, if you have a lighter meal in store, and can actually find the Gotsa, grab it. But if you want the whole show and full Basque experience while still being able to enjoy it with your meal, you should go for the Bereziartua. And while you’re at it, raise a glass to the Basque country. Next year in San Sebastian! Txotx!",

        "Body": "Spain has some of the richest and longest cider heritages in the world and there are two main cider producing regions in the country, both in the north—Asturias in northwest Spain and the Basque region in north-central Spain. Recently I did a review of four Basque-style ciders, and I decided to take the winner of that (Bereziartua) and put it up against Pome Áurea which the Dean of Cider Professor recommended it to me calling it “absolutely remarkable.” So, I procured a bottle, and sat down to review the two side by side. From the outset I recognize I am reviewing Trabanco’s sidra espumante against a sidra natural, and maybe should have used a bottle of Trabanco’s sidra natural to get a true comparison. But I decided I could wait no longer. <br> Pome Áurea is obviously more bubbly and light where the Bereziartua looks mature with a dark golden color. That maturity translates into a phenolic, lightly funky flavor that is more acidic, tannic, and layered. The richness of the apples really shine through, even though it is heavier and more complex than Pome Áurea. I think Bereziartua would probably also go well with fattier, spicier foods. The Pome Áurea is light and lovely and is one of the most well-balanced ciders I’ve ever had. It has this slightly fruity finish that is just, wow! Sophisticated and simple with an incredibly clean mouthfeel. <br> This may reveal my preference for style of cider more than anything, but I don’t think there is much of a comparison between the Bereziartua and the Trabanco. While I love the Bereziartua for its complexity, funk and depth, the smooth and elegant nature of the Pome Áurea is flawless. I can’t find fault in it and the balance and simple excellence cannot be matched by its eastern neighbor. I know which you chose should be influenced by your preferred style, mood and dinner plans, but unless you are serving pinxtos and want something a little funky, the smooth sophistication of the Pome Áurea cannot be equaled. Simplistic cider excellence in a classy bottle. I don’t know if you can get your hands on this, but if you can, do. Then show off to all your friends what fermented apples from northern Spain can do. Move over champagne, screw grapes, give me Spanish cider from Trabanco!",

        "Body": "Tradition has it that this apple was discovered at the end of the 19th century by Mr. Bartlett of Yarlington, England, who found this wild apple growing out of the stone cracks of the local mill. It has become a favorite of anglophone cider makers across the Atlantic for its aromatic and bittersweet qualities which are good for cider. Tonight though, I have two cider makers trying their hand at this single varietal coming from the green hills outside of Portland—Bauman’s to the southwest and Stone Hill just to the southeast. <br> Bauman’s is clearly fizzier as Stone Circle is flat. It also has a lighter sweeter nose than the deeper heavier aroma of Stone Circle which has more mystique. Bauman’s has an interesting oily/buttery nose with a hint of sugar. It is super dry, almost soapy in mouthfeel. I’m pretty sure my lips had a hard time rubbing together after drinking it. Even though it is dryer, it has more of a brighter acidity and is less dour compared to the Stone Circle. Stone Circle is also super dry with some bitterness in the finish. Its acidity has a more alcoholic, heavier, quality to it. It is, however, tarter and does have some fruit peeking through the heaviness. <br> Both were good, but I loved neither. I must admit that they both have evidence of the pitfalls of not blending for the best qualities of different varietals. Both are a bit monotone, very tannic and somewhat stodgy. It is hard for me to picture many moods I’d want the Stone Circle. Maybe if I had the right food to cut the lumbersome cider? But the dourness is there, and I tend to drink cider for its joviality, not for a heavy, dark, alcoholic taste that will induce more dreariness. I exaggerate, but this is only for particular palates (and old men in torn tweed jackets). The Bauman’s has a bit more life to it, but is so so dry it can be hard to drink down. It does have a richness though that gives it character that certain connoisseurs may really enjoy.",

        "ID": 122,
        "Body": "Perry is cider’s ancient cousin and fermented pear juice goes back to the Greeks and is basically Biblical. Even though it has had a long life in Europe, a number of American modern cider makers have put their twist on this old-world classic. Tonight’s perry collection comes from three of my favorite regional cider makers from across the country: Massachusetts’ Downeast is known for their unfiltered craft cider and Pear is their attempt at a perry. The second is Colorado Cider Company’s Pearzarro, which is the more sophisticated of the two perries they make. And finally, Nat West’s Valley of the Pear which is one of his latest concoctions complete with an outrageous culinary travel backstory. In many ways these perries represent the best of the American cider industry’s take on how to make an American perry. <br> The colors are all noticeably different as Downeast is a cloudy pastel yellow, Pearzarro is a somewhat bizarre clear color and Valley of the Pear looks much like your typical amber drink. All three noses are fantastic. Valley of the Pear has a creamsicle and pie aroma with the least amount of pear, Pearzarro has subtle yeasty notes and is lovely, and Downeast has the brightest nose with the strongest pear smell (which I preferred). Valley of the Pear has the most going on flavor wise and has the thickest heaviest mouthfeel. It is creamy and sweet. Downeast is soft, light and airy. Incredibly refreshing. It feels like you could put this in one of those giant orange Gatorade jugs and serve this during halftime of an adult rugby league game. The Pearzarro is also light but it is the most rustic of the three. It is the most like a traditional perry with unique acidic characteristics. It is also the driest of the three with the best finish. <br> Let’s face it, choosing between these three is a fool’s errand for me.  I’d be so happy to find any of these in my fridge and would be glad to share these with my friends. But as I said, they are all incredibly diverse so it depends on your moods and taste. The Pearzarro is the most sophisticated of the three despite its comic book can art, and it is the most like an old world perry. However, despite the wild fermentation and slight raw and acidic first impression, it smooths out quickly and is incredibly soft and light for a farmhouse-style perry. It has the most edge but is still smooth and enjoyable. Wine lovers may enjoy this drink and I think it is the most suitable for fine food pairing. The Rev. Nat’s is what it should be—brilliantly complicated yet enjoyable and drinkable. This is the American perry I want in the winter. It’s got holiday spice but is still sweet and drinkable all night long. It is so creamy it’s almost like the perfect liquid dessert. Even though the first two were excellent (and I hope to have them both again soon) tonight I am choosing Downeast for two main reasons. First, I spent six hours in the sun today staining my fence and it is the most refreshing. Second, It took me back to my grandma’s backyard next to the creek on a hot summer’s day. It is a bit sweet and incredibly soft and smooth and would be refreshing for any summer day in America.",

        "Body": "What are brambleberries? It is a little confusing because it is an umbrella term for any fruit that grows on brambles—a prickly shrub—and thus includes all kinds of blackberries and raspberries as well as hybrids like boysenberries. Tonight I have two ciders promoting “brambles” instead of particular fruits: Sea Cider of Vancouver Island’s  Bramble Bubbly, and from the opposite North American coast, Blue Bee’s Mill Trace Bramble from Virginia. While both use bramble for marketing purposes, and Bramble Bubbly only uses the term “bramble berries,” to my tongue Blue Bee tastes more like raspberries where it is clear Sea Cider is using blackberries. So how do they compare? <br> The Canadian cider as a deeper, darker and more mellow aroma compared to Blue Bee, which if fizzier in the glass and on the palate and has a tarter nose. Both of these have lingering tastes—in the Bramble bubbly it is an alcohol taste that lingers and in Mille Race it is the tartness. Bramble Bubbly is heavier, with a huge blackberry flavor that is slightly sweet with an almost artificial taste. Mill Race is lighter, more bitter, earthier and dryer. <br> Both of these are good ciders I’d be happy to run into when out with friends, but each had an aspect I didn’t love. For Sea Cider their heavy viscous blackberry flavor was borderline artificial tasting, where the Mill Race Bramble felt stuck between two styles—it was light but not easy drinking and dryish but not complex enough. Instead it had a light earthy bitterness that didn’t fit well in either genre. So, choosing is going to come down to mood and preference. Do you want a lighter, dryer cider with a tart and earthy raspberry flavor? Or do you want a heavier, richer, wine-like flavor with a clear alcoholic kick? I’m gonna go with the slow, rich and fruity sipper from Canada.",

Even if you aren’t particularly patriotic or are an ex-pat just living here, if you’re in America on the Fourth you’re celebrating and eating. The weather is probably perfect, if not a little hot in many places, and so you’re outside, you’re grilling, you’ve got the gingham table cloth, and you may or may not have driven across the county line to get better fireworks. Regardless, you better be serving pie. And why not have a cherry pie? Two delicious ciders that try to capture the essence of a cherry pie on the Fourth are Atlanta Hard Cider Company’s Cherry Pie and Rev. Nat’s Cherry Pie from Oregon. <br> Both are pretty in the glass. Rev. Nat’s looks like an amber brown ale, where Atlanta’s has a beautiful red color that I found striking. Rev. Nat’s smells like mincemeat pies where Atlanta had a brighter and crisper nose. It was also lighter, sweeter and simpler, though the cinnamon gave it just enough texture to perk up your palate. Rev. Nat’s is heavier, more somber, and more complex. Lots of things going on in your mouth at the same time. <br> While both cider makers were trying to create the same experience, the moods were totally different and that should inform your choice. The choice for me was not easy as both are great. I think both of these drinks transported me places. The Atlanta Cherry Pie took me to a hot summer bbq where it provided the perfect refreshment throughout the afternoon. The Rev. Nat’s took me to a cold and stodgy English fall where I pulled hot mincemeat pies out of the oven—warm, savory, with a hint of sweetness and spiced just right. In some ways these drinks reflect the locales thy were made—bright and sunny Atlanta and occasionally cloudy and drizzly Portland. So, I guess the question you have to ask yourself this Fourth of July is are you planning on wearing flannel or topsiders to your get together? While I think Rev. Nat’s is the cider of choice if you’re bundled up by the fire—as Rev. Nat’s is serving up a savory and spiced drink the way only he can. But if it is warm and you can feel the sun on your face, Atlanta is lighter and more refreshing, and I what I want to drink at this year’s cookout.",

        "ID": 125,
        "Body": "Blending. I don’t want to sound blasphemous, but sometimes when humans blend various apples together, it is better than what mother nature offers in a single apple. And let’s face it, blending is what separates the cider artists form those that just make what the good Lord gave them. Tonight, I have three interpretations of “blends” from three cidermakers I respect a lot. The first comes from the Pacific Northwest, 2 Towns 10th Anniversary Release consists of a blend of six cider apple varietals coming from “the valley they call home.” The second comes from San Diego County at the southern edge of America’s west coast. Though they don’t reveal the five varietals, they all come from the mountains just inland from Southtown at about 4000’ elevation. Finally, we have a “New England Blend” from Stem Ciders, probably the largest cidery in Colorado, a hotbed of cider activity. So, let’s break these three down: <br> Just looking at them the 2 Towns is the bubbliest, Amalgam slightly less so and Stem is the least bubbly and pretty still. The colors move in the other direction though as 2 Towns is a straw color, Amalgam a nice pale gold, and Stem is a pale amber. The 2 Towns has a light nose, Amalgam is slightly heavy, and Stem is dark and slightly mysterious—and my choice for best aroma. The 10th Anniversary from 2 Towns has some whimsy. It is more like a fancy semi-sweet cider that is light and fruity, tart and sweet. Amalgam is like a farmhouse cider but not too aggressive with plenty of apple flavor left. It is complex and serious with a unique finish. Lastly, the New England Blend is heavy and dense. It is the least acidic, but also has the least amount of fruit. It is a bit bitter and is definitely the driest—ignore that it says it has brown sugar, this will not taste like an Austin Eastcider which also famously uses brown sugar. There is also a prominent whiskey flavor from the barrel aging. <br> If this were a book it would be “Goldilocks and the Three Blends.” 2 Towns is the baby blend—light, sweet, and refreshing. Anyone could like this. Amalgam is the mama blend—there are sweet and apply moments, but this is a grown up drink—a farmhouse not for the uninitiated, but perfect for those willing to dig deeper and can handle the acidity and still enjoy the unique characteristics of unique apple varietals. While potent, it has enough sweetness to maybe get you by. Finally, the New England Blend is the daddy blend. This is the most whiskey-like cider I’ve had in a while, especially as it is not branded as one. While old-school New England ciders are known for raisin and brown sugar, you shouldn’t be fooled, this is not a cheery, light-hearted, Norman Rockwell painting of Deerfield, it is a man’s drink (or for tough ladies). It is more attuned to a drinking jacket and cigar than with a fruity light-hearted picnic in the Berkshires. Now, all of these are great, well made, ciders and are within two points of each other. So, the only question left is which chair do you want to sit in? Baby, mama, or daddy? Be honest. Depending on my mood, I could be any of the three. I may be baby bear most often, but tonight I’m mama bear as I think Amalgam is the best crafted of the three.",

Tonight, I’ve got blackberry ciders from two of my favorite regional powerhouses repping each coast, Downeast’s Blackberry and 2 Towns’ Made Marion. In fact, Made Marion was one of the first blackberry ciders I’ve ever had and I thought it would be good to put it up against the new release from Downeast. <br> It should be said at the outset that both of the cans rock the lavender shade and look sharp. The Blackberry has a sunrise salmon color were the Made Marion is much darker, almost matching a the hue of a good chianti. The nose of Blackberry is soft and gentle with some raspberry notes as well. The 2 Towns is dark, soulful and nothing but blackberries. When it comes to taste, Blackberry is cleaner or more balanced. It is so soft and smooth you drink a sixer of these without blinking an eye. Made Marion is heavier and more forceful. It also packs more of an acidic punch and gives you blackberry flavor from start to finish. <br> Blackberries have always been one of the best accompaniments to cider with their tart, acidic and rich character and both of these are outstanding examples—though noticeably different. I think I’ll chose the Downeast because it is so soft and refreshing. For a hot summer day this better foots the bill. However, many of you might prefer the bolder tarter blackberry-forward flavor of 2 Towns. Made Marion has beautiful, and compelling, tart notes that just make you pucker more, and which demand more attention. And somewhat ironically, I think it is better suited for crisp fall nights when drinking at a slower pace allows you to savor the rich flavor. Don’t get me wrong this is not an overdone complex drink, it is bursting with fruit flavor and is tart and tasty for sure, but compared to the lighter, chiller Downeast, it is more potent. If I wanted a punch of tart blackberry, I’d grab Made Merion, but when it comes to an easy to drink summer refresher, Downeast would be my choice.",

        "Body": "My three pineapple ciders tonight all come from the center of America, about as far away from the ocean as you can get in the country. But who doesn’t love the taste of a sweet and juicy pineapple? Each of these cider makers has tried their hand at a pineapple cider, but use a different element to try and elevate the dink in unique ways. Glacial Till of Nebraska has tried incorporating another fruit (passionfruit), while Pivot of Kentucky’s Taj Mahalo has gone the spiced chai route (though cinnamon is most prominent to my nose and tongue) and Michigan’s Blake’s Cider’s Rainbow Seeker claims sage notes in the description of their pineapple cider (though, honestly, none was detected). So how do these three compare? <br> Glacial Till is a pale straw, Rainbow seeker a nice golden straw, and Taj Mahalo a light amber that is slightly hazy. The best nose is the yummy vanilla aroma of the Rainbow Seeker. Taj Mahalo is the most intriguing as it smells likes pineapple pie and the Glacial Till is just too sweet and artificial smelling. That aroma is complemented by an overly sweet taste that is so sugary it masks everything else. Rainbow Seeker is the bubbliest and has a thicker mouthfeel than Taj Mahalo. It is also creamier and softer. Lastly, the Taj Mahalo is bolder and has a more sustained flavor throughout all three phases. It is also the most savory of the three with those cinnamon and chai notes. <br> For me, Glacial Till is just not in the running as its sweetness level is too out of control. Its artificial sugariness masks the subtleties of the passionfruit and to a lesser degree, the punch of the pineapple. The mouthfeel is nice, and its smoothness is noteworthy, but for most cider drinkers it’ll be too sugary sweet. That leaves Blake’s and Pivot. I found both of these very good and graded them similarly (though neither made it into the top echelon of pineapple ciders for me). But one has to chose. Both add more savory elements to the pineapple—creamy vanilla for Blake’s and a spiced pie feel for Pivot. I think if I was wanting a more chill cider for just hanging out with friends or relaxing by the beach, the Rainbow Seeker would be my choice. It isn’t too sweet or too fruity. For those who want it bold and to spice things up a bit, Pivot gave me something I haven’t had before, a baked pineapple pie and the sensation of tart and cinnamon at the same time. So, if you’re looking for something unique, something interesting, and think you’d like both sweet and savory in a single swig, say yes and thank you to Pivot’s Taj Mahalo.",

        "Body": "A ripe, soft and juicy mango that is right off the tree and scored the proper way is a marvel when you pull the soft flesh off the skin. Even more so on a hot summer day. As we are now into August, I thought I would pull two mango ciders from my fridge: Rekorderlig of Sweden’s Mango-Raspberry and Pivot’s Two to Mango from Kentucky. The comparison and breakdown for this will be quick as the Mango-Raspberry is way too sweet, with a sugary and artificial taste that takes it out of the running. It has a slightly-off nose which couldn’t be forgotten or overlooked when drinking it The bubblegum-pink color should have been a warning. It was so sugary and sweet it made strawberry soda blush. I have had a couple of Rekorderligs before which were sweet but enjoyable, but I just couldn’t finish this one. Mango, raspberry and apple seems like it had potential, but it just fell down in the execution. The Pivot Two to Mango on the other hand was a really great drink, even if it had some flaws. I think apple, pear and mango really worked well together to create a soft and delightful cider, somewhat reminiscent of that of that fresh-scored mango. You can tell it is not fresh mango juice, but they still created a really nice cocktail which starts off as a smooth and sweet perry before you get a big bump of mango in the finish. The lack of carbonation and low levels of acidity—that switch midway from malic to citric—leads to a gentle, soft and sweet people pleaser which is perfect for an easy-going afternoon in the sun.",

        "Body": "I know hibiscus flowers are more likely to be equated with the warmer climes of Southern California, but two NorCal cider makers have tried their luck turning the flower into good cider. (Though for the green thumbs out there it should be noted that heartier species of hibiscus will take in Northern California) Both are adding something a little lighter, fruitier and more floral to their lineups. The first is Common Cider Company’s Hibiscus Saison coming from the foothills outside of Sac-Town and the second is Sonoma County’s Golden State Cider which has branded their hibiscus cider as Jamaica to more instantly try and take their consumer to some place more tropical. So how did these Northern Californian hibiscus ciders compare? <br> Well first, something has to be said about the can art. The photo/drawing of the guitar player doesn’t do it for me. I’d be a bit embarrassed walking around with that. I mean, he is not even a playing a real chord. On the other hand, Jamaica is simple, elegant, and classy. But on to more substantive issues. Common has a deep, still and rich nose that is fruity and preferable to the aroma of Jamaica which is much sharper and more acidic. Common is a bit sugary, not in an overly sweet way, but probably too much for some. Jamaica is crisper, comparatively pungent with more acidity and a tiny amount of earthiness. There is definitely more of a raw apple flavor in there and it has a heavier body compared to Common, but generally speaking still pretty light. However, there is a more robust mouthfeel throughout all three phases. <br> I think choosing a winner is pretty easy based on what kind of cider drinker you are. Are you more of a casual cider drinker that likes and expects their cider to be more sugary sweet? Common is more of a people pleaser in that regard. It is more like a soft soda or a sugary alcho-pop. Golden State on the other hand is more for your purist cider drinker willing to dabble with a certain amount of fusion. This is clearly a cider that is apple forward with even some raw apple notes mixed in and some sharpness from the acidity. It is dry and light, stemming in part from the champagne yeast. Even though it is softened by the floral fruity notes, it maintains its character as a cider. I think Jamaica is really good where I think Common is just, common. But then again, I tend to prefer a proper cider in my old age. Regardless, if I’m in Northern California again on a warm day, I might grab Golden State’s version of a Jamaican paradise.",

        "ID": 130,
        "Body": "The introduction of glass bottles by the Venetians in the 1600s allowed for a new method of fermenting wines and ciders which created a natural petulant drink, though this method is now considered ancient. With both Pet-Nat and Method Ancestrale bottle conditioning, cider begins its first fermentation process in other vessels, but before the process is completed, it is transferred to bottles to continue the secondary fermentation process in the bottle, which gives off its own natural carbon dioxide. The bottles are usually placed upside down at an angle on racks in a process known as riddling. This allows for the sediment to settle in the neck before being disgorged by hand. Deceptively simple there are lots of things that can go wrong and it is usually only taken up by the intrepid or those with large supply of mops and cleaning products to clean up the mess. Two of the most respected cider makers count bottle conditioning techniques as part of their repertoire. Eden’s starts their Sparkling Dry Cider blend in French oak barrels before being transferred to bottles. Haykin Family Cider’s Ela Family Cuveé uses the method ancestrale where nothing is added during the secondary fermentation process and uses a blend of a number of different apple varietals including Cox’s Orange Pippin, Ashmead’s Kernal, Jonathan, Golden Delicious and others. <br> I preferred the nose of the Eden cider which had a much richer aroma. The flavor, however, was not nearly as big or as bold. There was not a lot apple flavor and a clear heavy alcohol flavor dominated the middle phase. The actual taste was heavy, dryer, more bitter and more acidic than the Haykin Cuvee. More mellow for sure. The Haykin cider was creamier, lighter, airier, and bubblier than the Eden cider. They get so many unique flavors out of their apples, which is a testament in part to Ela Farms, but overall, this is soft and nuanced which created a calming experience. <br> The clear winner in this head-to-head taste test was the Haykin option, though I found myself drawn to Eden and continued to come back to it even after I decided the winner. It is an inspiring drink and very good, but it depends on what you are looking for. Cider often evokes images and moods when I drink them. For me, the Eden was best suited to a dark and smokey room—you have to be up for a heavier more serious cider. They Haykin took me to a big house in Bermuda where I was wearing billowy clothes and enjoying a calm ocean breeze. In the end the Haykin just used more lively apples that had more character and charm. This drink is truly special.",

        "Body": "I am just going to come out and say it. I do not think I am a fan of strawberry cider. The two I’ve had previously were uninspiring. However, two of my favorite cider makers have put the red berry to work in their creations so I thought I’d give it another try. Pivot (Kentucky) has added kiwi to theirs—a classic combo with strawberry—and Hale and True (Pennsylvania) has gone for the more mysterious lemon pairing—though I guess strawberry lemonade is a thing, right? Finally, I came across the strawberry option from cider giant Angry Orchard (New York), so I decided to line them all up and give strawberry at least one more shot. <br> Gingham is the prettiest in the glass with a light cranberry color, Goldberry is straw colored and Angry Orchard has a nice amber tint that looks the most like your traditional cider. I also thought Gingham had the best nose with lush fruit notes, whereas Goldberry was potent with bright citric acid and Angry Orchard had an artificial smell. When it came to flavor, Gingham had the biggest strawberry experience, whereas Goldberry was the most subtle and Angry Orchard most like a strawberry soda. The Angry Orchard option was the smoothest of the three and the drinkability was pretty good. Gingham was the tartest and sweetest, and Goldberry tasted the most like proper apple cider. <br> Okay, so I’m still not a believer, but some were better than others. The Angry Orchard starts out pretty good and it feels like their standard semi-sweet base—which I actually think is pretty good for a standard semi-sweet—but then when that strawberry flavor comes in, I just get strawberry soda vibes that I don’t care for. The Gingham is the biggest and sweetest option with bold sweet and tart flavors. If you are looking for a bold strawberry drink that may make you pucker, you fount it. Sweet and big, but balanced. For me though, as something of a cider purist, I’m gonna go for the dry but subtle cider, the Goldberry. It is good, but not great. Now that I think about it, my daughter loves strawberries but refuses to eat anything strawberry flavored. Even though she might just be stubborn, I am starting to think she may be on to something. Strawberries are incredible. Cider is incredible. Strawberry-flavored ciders . . . meh. . . I could live without them.",

        "ID": 132,
        "Body": "I’ve got two barrel-aged ciders today that I suspect are not your typical heavy whiskey-like barrel-aged ciders. They hail from opposite ends of the country. Representing the Pacific Northwest is Union Hill’s Barrell-Aged Hard Cider and from Vermont, Shacksbury’s Lo-Ball, which comes in a short little can that I am not sure I get. (Like lowball cocktail glasses meets a low pitch in baseball?) <br> The barrel aging is more pronounced in the Union Hill drink as you get a whiskey-like aroma in the nose and in flavor. The Lo-Ball which is a lighter golden straw color, has a very strongly citric nose and a very tart and tangy experience. The Lo-Ball is lighter bodied with a smoother mouthfeel and in one sense has better drinkability than Union Hill, but only in small doses. The citrus flavor is so puckery you can not quaff this. Union Hill has more of bite, it is bubblier and also quite drinkable. It is clearly the more complex of the two with both sweet and sharp apple varietals used which combined with the aging in wine barrels gives it added layers to the experience. <br> Even though I categorized both in the “Tart n’ Tasty” Mood category, Lo-Ball is more for those that really want to pucker up. So, I think it obviously depends on what you are looking for. There is tartness in the union Hill drink that is way more complex with different textures and more of an edge, whereas Lo-ball is more straight forward—and by straightforward I mean prepare to pucker up. The mouthfeel is smooth but it’s got a whole lotta lemon. You looking for a little punch? A little zesty pick me up? Then try a Lo-Ball. But if you want to sit and savor your drink, or if you are looking to pair a drink with some food, (I have in mind spicy meats) Union Hill is going to be your best option. Woody, edgy, yet fruity and drinkable. A great cider that is versatile in a number of situations.",

        "Body": "Cider is intriguing, and wine is flattering, but good perry is to be praised. I’m always in the hunt for my next favorite perry and so I have turned to two cider makers who take their craft seriously (which is reflected in the price tags) who have tried their hands at creating exceptional pear ciders. Art+Science are undoubtedly innovative and have made some of my favorite cider, as well as some I didn’t love including a previous perry that really disappointed. I have paired their Mutualism—which is technically a co-fermentation with 75% Bosc pears and 25% Sauvignon Blanc grapes—with Snow Capped’s Winter Pear from their Specialty series. While Snow Capped came to cider through the mass market front door, they have put their 100+ years of growing apples into more single varieties and heirloom blends as of late. Because some of their modern ciders have proven to be a cut above their competitors, I was eager to try their top-shelf products for some time and decided to start with their perry. <br> The Mutualism is a cloudy straw color whereas the Winter Pear is a translucent muted gold that is bubblier. I preferred the nose of Mutualism which was unique with a floral spring mix aroma, though the more straight forward pear flavor of Snow Capped’s was quite nice as well. Though both use Bosc pears the two taste totally different. Mutualism is more acidic, more raw, and has more of an edge supplied in part by its barrel ageing. The Winter Pear has a truer pear flavor with a lighter and creamier mouthfeel. It’s crisper, more subtle, and retained more sweetness. The Mutualism is tangy, powerful and funky and you’d probably need something pretty spicey to cut it. On the other hand, Winter Pear is incredibly versatile and would go with lots of things—white meats or creamy rich meals. <br> Depending on your preferences you’ve probably already chosen after reading the comparative breakdown. Like funky, bold, tart or smokey ciders? Then Mutualism is the acidic pear cider you should check out. Though it has an edge, the grapes pull it back enough and smooth out some of the rough edges enough to make it drinkable and really good if you can take a tangy, citrusy punch. Otherwise, if you want a crisp and refreshing cider that goes down well and can be paired with virtually anything, Snow Capped’s slightly sweet, but creamy and deep, Winter Pear is quite exceptional. It doesn’t use any smoke and mirrors to grab your attention, it is a slightly sweet but well-balanced perry produced by ancient pear trees planted at elevation and lovingly cared for and fermented and blended by orchardists with five generations of experience caring about their fruit and understanding their terroir. If you drink it too fast you might just think it is a great sweet perry, but if you slow down enough, you can experience the subtle but charming personality of this perry that is oh so easy to drink. I wish I had another. Immensely pleasurable!",

        "Body": "The Dabinett apple is a classic English cider apple that oozes with charm when turned into cider, but not one you’d want to find on the dinner table. I have two interpretations of Dabinett from two of the most-feted and most-medaled cider makers from Colorado. The first offering comes from Haykin Family Cider, and I have learned to trust Dan Haykin’s nose and instincts for selecting and fermenting apples. The second option comes from Ty Williams of Snow Capped Cider who hails from a multi-generational Colorado orchard on the state’s Western Slope. In recent years they have been turning to high-end single varietals which boast a unique high-elevation terroir which in my estimation produces some excellent cider apples. So, let’s see what these two Colorado cider maestros have created. <br> The Haykin is a nice pale gold color with the Snow Capped being maybe one shade darker. The Snow Capped has a deeper nose, but I preferred the fruity and buttery nose of Haykin which also had a clear zing to it. Haykin’s Dabinett is more subtle with nice drying characteristics. It is more astringent and borderline bitter. It also has the lighter and brighter mouthfeel. One the other hand, Snow Capped has a bigger and sweeter flavor which is perfectly balanced for me. It is more of a semi-dry than a true dry. There is a mild burn at the end while remaining tart and fruity throughout. It also has a more viscous mouthfeel that feels more balanced that the Haykin. It should also be pointed out that whereas Snow Capped is a true single varietal, Haykin’s comes with 20% Ashmead’s Kernal, which you can clearly get hints of if you’ve ever experienced that unique apple in their ciders before. <br> From the outset I will say you can’t go wrong with either. They are both great and I would expect nothing less than the great amount of tender love and care that these two cider makers have shown. So how to chose when they come in at comparable price points? As Socrates says, “know thyself.” If you like a light-bodied bright cider with astringent and drying characteristics that will take you to a satisfyingly bitter place, then Haykin is the cider for you. I also think that this is a better cider for pairing—do you have something salty or light to eat? That would amplify the unique flavors of the Haykin option and be fantastic. However, for me, the Snow Capped is a better drinking cider. I would have this by itself all evening. It goes down incredibly well and has enough character to be drunk by itself or with bigger, richer foods. It reminds me of a good Pays d’Augue with both sweetness and depth. (Yes, yes, I know the apples come from the wrong side of the Channel) This medium-to-full bodied cider is still effortless to drink. Both of these ciders showcase the richness of the Dabinett, and while Haykin Family Cider is the more contemplative and unique of the two, I give the nod to Snow Capped because of the mouthfeel and conviviality. I want to buy another bottle and share it with my colleagues at a cheery Christmas party.",

        "Title": "Cranberry for Christmas",
        "ID": 135,
        "Body": "Here’s my dirty little secret, my favorite dish at Thanksgiving is the cranberry sauce—not the fancy homemade sauce that comes with little bits in it that my mom makes for the other guests, but the stuff that comes straight out of the can with that gross slurping noise when it plops out. In fact, you can keep the rest of it, the turkey, my uncle’s pecan pie, I just want a spoon and the 98¢ can from Ocean Spray. <br> Last holiday season it felt like every cider maker and their mom were introducing a cran-cider, so I thought I’d line a few up for this holiday season in case you were wanting to serve one with a Christmas meal. Two are newer to the scene: Old Mine’s Crandlebar and Austin Eastciders’ Cranberry Cider. Because I have made a habit of doing side-by-side comparisons with the two biggest cider producers in Texas, I also decided to include Bishop’s mainstay, Crackberry. Finally, we have the recent re-introduction of Downeast’s Cranberry. This used to be in their lineup but they pulled it and gave a scolding letter to their fans for requesting it, but not buying it. I am unsure what the change of heart was after all these years, but it’s back . . . to my pleasure. Having lived in southeastern Mass, just down the road from Downeast and in a house that backed up to a bog, I admit I expect big things from this major producer from New England. I still have great memories scooping cranberries with my kids in Carver and I’ve got pretty high expectations. But time to break it down. <br> Old Mine has the most cranberry color, Austin is salmon, Downeast is neon watermelon and Bishop has a brownish hue. In reverse order, Bishop’s nose is the least cranberry as the blackberry smell is most prominent, Downeast has a subtly sweet crisp nose, Austin is the most acidic, and Old Mine has deep fruity cherry notes in the nose. Crackberry from Bishop brings a more earthy acidic character to it with the blackberries. It has a smoother mouthfeel and is easier to drink than Downeast or Austin. It falls more or less in the center of the sweetness scale though possibly inching towards dry. Downeast is the brightest and tartest of the four, as well as the fleshiest. Its mouthfeel is fuller and softer and feels the most like fresh squeezed juice. It has an abruptly tart flavor towards the finish and is not easily quaffable. Wow, the Austin Eastcider is pretty tart! It is, however, dryer than the other three. However, the mouthfeel is thin and left me wanting more. Lastly, the Old Mine is the most drinkable and very smooth. It is very bold and the flavors are all cranked up to ten, but at least they are balanced. This also has savory spice notes as well which are absent from the other three. <br> So how to choose? First, we can cross the Austin Eastciders off the list. It is just uninspired. Too acidic, with a weak mouthfeel. It just doesn’t cut it. For me, the next two that are very close in score are the older two—the Crackberry and the Downeast Cranberry. Clearly the Crackberry is the best cran cider in Texas, but how does it compare to a cider that hails from the cranberry capital of the world? (Go ahead, Michigan, take offense, it is not you) I will say that Downeast has a more authentic fruit juice feel, but that tartness in the finish is so arresting! Though I really like both, I give a slight nod to Crackberry because of its drinkability, though it too is tart, and may have less of that fresh and juicy cran feel, but I do think the blackberries provide a different acidic profile to make things interesting. That leaves the Old Mine. I know it’s been a long time since I have gone with the sweetest option in a comparative review, but Old Mine is my choice because it is the biggest, boldest, brightest and most festive of the four cran ciders. I see this as a sidekick to your neighbor’s Christmas Party as it pairs perfect with finger foods, fireplaces and the festive fat guy in the corner still rocking the red turtleneck with blazer. No matter how awkward it gets at the party, you could drink these all night and still be jolly. I know it’s sweet, and if that scares you, grab one of the two dryer options from Texas, but otherwise it is time to celebrate, so grab a glass or two of the scrumptious Old Mine Crandlebar!",
