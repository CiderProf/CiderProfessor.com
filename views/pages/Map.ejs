        <p>Cider enthusiasts often brag that there is a cider for every occasion. Taking this seriously, I have developed a classification system that will hopefully help guide you to the right cider depending on your mood. After all, drinking is largely experiential and oneâ€™s emotional and physical context should absolutely influence what they ought to drink. My list includes all the possible moods and moments one might want to drink a cider. Yes, it is a bit arbitrary, and yes, you could probably add a few of your own, but hopefully this gives you a better sense of when one might want to drink a particular cider and maybe even be a helpful category for finding ciders you love.
